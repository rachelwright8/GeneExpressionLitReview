They are sessile, inhabit shallow, tropical oceans and are highly dependent on sun- and moonlight to regulate sexual reproduction, phototaxis, and photosymbiosis. However, their exposure to high levels of sunlight also imposes an increased risk of UV-induced DNA damage. How have these challenging photic environments influenced photoreceptor evolution and function in these animals? To address this question, we initially screened the cnidarian photoreceptor repertoire for Anthozoa-specific signatures by a broad-scale evolutionary analysis. We compared transcriptomic data of more than 36 cnidarian species and revealed a more diverse photoreceptor repertoire in the anthozoan subphylum than in the subphylum Medusozoa. We classified the three principle opsin classes into distinct subtypes and showed that Anthozoa retained all three classes, which diversified into at least six subtypes. In contrast, in Medusozoa, only one class with a single subtype persists. Similarly, in Anthozoa, we documented three photolyase classes and two cryptochrome (CRY) classes, whereas CRYs are entirely absent in Medusozoa. Interestingly, we also identified one anthozoan CRY class, which exhibited unique tandem duplications of the core functional domains. We next explored the functionality of anthozoan photoreceptors in the model species Exaiptasia diaphana (Aiptasia), which recapitulates key photo-behaviors of corals. We show that the diverse opsin genes are differentially expressed in important life stages common to reef-building corals and Aiptasia and that CRY expression is light regulated. We thereby provide important clues linking coral evolution with photoreceptor diversification.","0737-4038","1537-1719",NA,"MAY",2021,38,"5",1744,"1760","","10.1093/molbev/msaa304",NA,"","WOS:000654668800004",33226083,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

Here, we used RNA-seq on the sea anemone Exaiptasia pallida (Ep) strain CC7 as a model to depict the innate immune response during the onset of infection with the marine pathogenic bacteria Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Vp) clinical strain O3:K6, and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) exposure. Pairwise and time series analyses identified the genes responsive to infection as well as the kinetics of innate immune genes over time. Comparisons between the responses to live Vp and purified LPS was then performed.ResultsGene expression and functional analyses detected hundreds to thousands of genes responsive to the Vp infection after 1, 3, 6 and 12h, including a few shared with the response to LPS. Our results bring to light the first indications that non-canonical cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as NOD-like and RIG-I-like receptor homologs take part in the immune response of Ep. Over-expression of several members of the lectin-complement pathways in parallel with novel transmembrane and Ig containing ficolins (CniFLs) suggest an active defense against the pathogen. Although lacking typical Toll-like receptors (TLRs), Ep activates a TLR-like pathway including the up-regulation of MyD88, TRAF6, NF-kappa B and AP-1 genes, which are not induced under LPS treatment and therefore suggest an alternative ligand-to-PRR trigger. Two cytokine-dependent pathways involving Tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs) and several other potential downstream signaling genes likely lead to inflammation and/or apoptosis. Finally, both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways were strongly supported by over-expression of effector and executioner genes.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this pioneering study is first to follow the kinetics of the innate immune response in a cnidarian during the onset of infection with a bacterial pathogen. Overall, our findings reveal the involvement of both novel immune gene candidates such as NLRs, RLRs and CniFLs, and previously identified TLR-like and apoptotic pathways in anthozoan innate immunity with a large amount of transcript-level evidence.","1471-2164","",NA,"9-Nov",2020,21,"1",NA,"","768","10.1186/s12864-020-07140-6",NA,"","WOS:000590724100001",33167855,NA,NA,NA,NA,"pathogen",1,"none",1

The rheostat regulates levels of pro-survival sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and pro-apoptotic sphingosine (Sph) through catalytic activities of sphingosine kinase (SPHK) and S1P phosphatase (SGPP). The role of the rheostat in recognition and establishment of cnidarian-Symbiodinium symbiosis was investigated in the sea anemone Aiptasia pallida by measuring gene expression, protein levels, and sphingolipid metabolites in symbiotic, aposymbiotic, and newly recolonized anemones. Comparison of two host populations showed that symbiotic animals from one population had lower SGPP gene expression and Sph lipid concentrations compared to aposymbiotic animals, while the other population had higher S1P concentrations than their aposymbiotic counterparts. In both populations, the host rheostat trended toward host cell survival in the presence of symbionts. Furthermore, upregulation of both rheostat enzymes on the first day of host recolonization by symbionts suggests a role for the rheostat in host-symbiont recognition during symbiosis onset.

Here we combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to characterize the molecular, cellular, and physiological processes that underlie this compatibility, with a particular focus on Symbiodinium trenchii, an opportunistic, thermally tolerant symbiont that flourishes in coral tissues after bleaching events. Symbiont-free individuals of the sea anemone Exaiptasia pallida (commonly referred to as Aiptasia), an established model system for the study of the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, were colonized with the ""normal"" (homologous) symbiont Symbiodinium minutum and the heterologous S. trenchii. Analysis of the host gene and metabolite expression profiles revealed that heterologous symbionts induced an expression pattern intermediate between the typical symbiotic state and the aposymbiotic state. Furthermore, integrated pathway analysis revealed that increased catabolism of fixed carbon stores, metabolic signaling, and immune processes occurred in response to the heterologous symbiont type.

They form the trophic and structural foundation of coral reef ecosystems, and have played a key role in the evolutionary radiation and biodiversity of cnidarian species. Despite the prevalence of these symbioses, we still know very little about the molecular modulators that initiate, regulate, and maintain the interaction between these two different biological entities. In this study, we conducted a comparative host anemone transcriptome analysis using a cDNA microarray platform to identify genes involved in cnidarian - algal symbiosis. Results: We detected statistically significant differences in host gene expression profiles between sea anemones ( Anthopleura elegantissima) in a symbiotic and non-symbiotic state. The group of genes, whose expression is altered, is diverse, suggesting that the molecular regulation of the symbiosis is governed by changes in multiple cellular processes. In the context of cnidarian dinoflagellate symbioses, we discuss pivotal host gene expression changes involved in lipid metabolism, cell adhesion, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Conclusion: Our data do not support the existence of symbiosis- specific genes involved in controlling and regulating the symbiosis. Instead, it appears that the symbiosis is maintained by altering expression of existing genes involved in vital cellular processes. Specifically, the finding of key genes involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis have led us to hypothesize that a suppression of apoptosis, together with a deregulation of the host cell cycle, create a platform that might be necessary for symbiont and/or symbiont-containing host cell survival. This first comprehensive molecular examination of the cnidarian - dinoflagellate associations provides critical insights into the maintenance and regulation of the symbiosis.","1471-2164","",NA,"10-Feb",2006,7,"",NA,"","23","10.1186/1471-2164-7-23",NA,"","WOS:000236183800001",16472376,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

Dysfunction and collapse of symbiosis lead to bleaching (symbiont expulsion), which is responsible for the severe worldwide decline of coral reefs. Molecular signals are central to the stability of this partnership and are therefore closely related to coral health. To decipher inter-partner signaling, we developed genomic resources (cDNA library and microarrays) from the symbiotic sea anemone Anemonia viridis. Here we describe differential expression between symbiotic (also called zooxanthellate anemones) or aposymbiotic (also called bleached) A. viridis specimens, using microarray hybridizations and qPCR experiments. We mapped, for the first time, transcript abundance separately in the epidermal cell layer and the gastrodermal cells that host photosynthetic symbionts. Transcriptomic profiles showed large inter-individual variability, indicating that aposymbiosis could be induced by different pathways. We defined a restricted subset of 39 common genes that are characteristic of the symbiotic or aposymbiotic states. We demonstrated that transcription of many genes belonging to this set is specifically enhanced in the symbiotic cells (gastroderm). A model is proposed where the aposymbiotic and therefore heterotrophic state triggers vesicular trafficking, whereas the symbiotic and therefore autotrophic state favors metabolic exchanges between host and symbiont. Several genetic pathways were investigated in more detail: i) a key vitamin K-dependant process involved in the dinoflagellate-cnidarian recognition; ii) two cnidarian tissue-specific carbonic anhydrases involved in the carbon transfer from the environment to the intracellular symbionts; iii) host collagen synthesis, mostly supported by the symbiotic tissue. Further, we identified specific gene duplications and showed that the cnidarian-specific isoform was also up-regulated both in the symbiotic state and in the gastroderm. Our results thus offer new insight into the inter-partner signaling required for the physiological mechanisms of the symbiosis that is crucial for coral health.","1553-7390","",NA,"JUL",2011,7,"7",NA,"","e1002187","10.1371/journal.pgen.1002187",NA,"","WOS:000293338600036",21811417,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

In corals, the interpretation of rhythmic behaviours is complicated by the daily oscillations in tissue oxygen tension resulting from the photosynthetic and respiratory activities of the associated algal endosymbiont Symbiodinium. In order to better understand the integration of biological clocks in cnidarian hosts of Symbiodinium, daily rhythms of behaviour and gene expression were studied in symbiotic and aposymbiotic morphs of the sea-anemone Aiptasia diaphana. Results: The results showed that whereas circatidal (approx. 12-h) cycles of activity and gene expression predominated in aposymbiotic morphs, circadian (approx. 24-h) patterns were the more common in symbiotic morphs, where the expression of a significant number of genes shifted from a 12-to 24-h rhythm. The behavioural experiments on symbiotic A. diaphana displayed diel (24-h) rhythmicity in body and tentacle contraction under the light/dark cycles, whereas aposymbiotic morphs showed approximately 12-h (circatidal) rhythmicity. Reinfection experiments represent an important step in understanding the hierarchy of endogenous clocks in symbiotic associations, where the aposymbiotic Aiptasia morphs returned to a 24-h behavioural rhythm after repopulation with algae.

The purpose of this study was to (1) characterize complement pathway genes in the symbiotic sea anemone Aiptasia (2) investigate the evolution of complement genes in invertebrates, and (3) examine the potential dual role of complement genes Factor B and MASP in the onset and maintenance of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis and immune challenge using qPCR based studies. The results demonstrate that A. pallida has multiple Factor B genes (Ap_Bf-1. Ap_Bf-2a, and Ap_Bf-2b) and one MASP gene (Ap_MASP).

Gene expression analyses revealed a potential role for complement in both onset and maintenance of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis and immune challenge. Specifically, Ap_Bf-1 and Ap_MASP are significantly upregulated in the light at the onset of symbiosis and in response to challenge with the pathogen Serratia marcescens suggesting that they play a role in the initial recognition of both beneficial and harmful microbes. Ap_Bf-2b in contrast, was generally downregulated during the onset and maintenance of symbiosis and in response to challenge with S. marcescens. Therefore, the exact role of Ap_Bf-2b in response to microbes remains unclear, but the results suggest that the presence of microbes leads to repressed expression. Together, these results indicate functional divergence between Ap_Bf-1 and Ap_Bf-2b, and that Ap_Bf-1 and Ap_MASP may be functioning together in an ancestral hybrid of the lectin and alternative complement pathways.

As apoptosis, autophagy and immunity have previously been shown to be involved in cnidarian symbiosis and disease, the goal of this research was to determine the role of cnidarian GIMAPs in these processes using the anemone Exaiptasia pallida. To do so, GIMAP genes were characterized in the E. pallida genome and changes in gene expression were measured using qPCR in response to chemical induction of apoptosis, autophagy and treatment with the immune stimulant lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in both aposymbiotic and symbiotic anemones. The results revealed four GIMAP-like genes in E. pallida, referred to as Ep GIMAPs. Induction of apoptosis and autophagy resulted in a general downregulation of Ep GIMAPs, but no significant changes were observed in response to LPS treatment. This indicates that Ep_GIMAPs may be involved in the regulation of apoptosis and autophagy, and therefore could play a role in cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. Overall, these results increase our knowledge on the function of GIMAPs in a basal metazoan.","0022-0949","1477-9145",NA,"NOV",2020,223,"21",NA,"","jeb229906","10.1242/jeb.229906",NA,"","WOS:000590598700018",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"pathogen",1,"none",1

The significance of these bleaching events to the health of coral reef ecosystems is extreme, as bleached corals exhibit high mortality, reduced fecundity, and productivity and increased susceptibility to disease. This decreased coral fitness leads to reef degradation and ultimately to the breakdown of the coral reef ecosystem. To date,there has been little work describing the application of biomarkers to assess coral health. The most commonly applied biomarker is, in fact, the bleaching event itself. We are interested in developing early warning biomarkers that can detect coral stress before bleaching occurs. Recently, several genes that are likely to function in regulating interactions between cnidarians and their symbionts have been characterized, using the temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima as a model species. One ""symbiosis gene"" identified from the host genome, sym32, is expressed as a function of anemone symbiotic-state, where sym32 expression is higher in symbiotic cf. aposymbiotic (symbiont-free) anemones. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR suggested that the level of sym32 expression was correlated with the abundance of algae in the host. Furthermore, laboratory exposures of anemones to low levels of cadmium (0, 20, 100 mug(-1) CdCl2; 14 days), which caused no change in algal cell numbers, resulted in a down-regulation of sym32 compared to controls, indicating that sym32 expression may serve as a new sensitive early warning biomarker of cnidarian-algal symbiosis breakdown.

We identified >500 genes that showed rapid and extensive up-regulation upon temperature increase. These genes fell into two clusters. In both clusters, most genes showed similar expression patterns in symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones, suggesting that this early stress response is largely independent of the symbiosis. Cluster I was highly enriched for genes involved in innate immunity and apoptosis, and most transcript levels returned to baseline many hours before bleaching was first detected, raising doubts about their possible roles in this process. Cluster II was highly enriched for genes involved in protein folding, and most transcript levels returned more slowly to baseline, so that roles in either promoting or preventing bleaching seem plausible. Many of the genes in clusters I and II appear to be targets of the transcription factors NF kappa B and HSF1, respectively. We also examined the behavior of 337 genes whose much higher levels of expression in symbiotic than aposymbiotic anemones in the absence of stress suggest that they are important for the symbiosis.

CA activity in brown anemones was highest, whereas activity in green and aposymbiotic anemones was low. Several CAs had expression patterns that mirrored activity, while another had expression that was inversely correlated with activity, suggesting that symbionts may induce different DIC transport pathways.

Accumulation of signaling sphingolipids that comprise the sphingosine rheostat, pro-apoptotic sphingosine (Sph) and pro-survival sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is key to determining cell fate. Reef-building corals and other symbiotic cnidarians living in shallow tropical waters can experience elevated seawater temperature and high UV irradiance, two stressors that are increasing in frequency and severity with climate change. In symbiotic cnidarians, these stressors disrupt the photosynthetic machinery of the endosymbiont and ultimately result in the collapse of the partnership (dysbiosis), known as cnidarian bleaching. In a previous study, exogenously applied sphingolipids altered heat-induced bleaching in the symbiotic anemone Aiptasia pallida, but endogenous regulation of these lipids is unknown. Here, we characterized the role of the rheostat in the cnidarian heat stress response (HSR) and in dysbiosis. Gene expression of rheostat enzymes sphingosine kinase (AP-SPHK) and S1P phosphatase (AP-SGPP), and concentrations of sphingolipids were quantified from anemones incubated at elevated temperatures. We observed a biphasic HSR in A. pallida. At early exposure, rheostat gene expression and lipid levels were suppressed while gene expression of a heat stress biomarker increased and 40% of symbionts were lost. After longer incubations at the highest temperature, AP-SGPP and then Sph levels both increased.

Although some studies have concluded that a breakdown in the symbiosis begins with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation within the symbiont due to a decoupling of photosynthesis, others have reported the release of viable symbionts via a variety of host cell derived mechanisms. We explored an alternative model focused upon changes in host cnidarian mitochondrial integrity in response to thermal stress. Mitochondria are often likened to being batteries of the cell, providing energy in the form of ATP, and controlling cellular pathway activation and ROS generation. The overall morphology of host mitochondria was compared to that of associated symbionts under an experimental thermal stress using confocal and electron microscopy. The results demonstrate that hyperthermic stress induces the degradation of cnidarian host mitochondria that is independent of symbiont cellular deterioration. The potential sites of host mitochondrial disruption were also assessed by measuring changes in the expression of genes associated with electron transport and ATP synthesis using quantitative RT-PCR. The primary site of degradation appeared to be downstream of complex III of the electron transport chain with a significant reduction in host cytochrome c and ATP synthase expression. The consequences of reduced expression could limit the capacity of the host to mitigate ROS generation and maintain both organelle integrity and cellular energy supplies. The disruption of host mitochondria, cellular homeostasis, and subsequent cell death irrespective of symbiont integrity highlights the importance of the host response to thermal stress and in symbiosis dysfunction that has substantial implications for understanding how coral reefs will survive in the face of climate change.","1932-6203","",NA,"16-Jul",2012,7,"7",NA,"","e39024","10.1371/journal.pone.0039024",NA,"","WOS:000306466100013",22815696,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1

To identify candidate genes relevant to the symbiotic stability, we performed transcriptomic analyses under multiple conditions using the symbiotic and apo-symbiotic (symbiont free) Exaiptasia diaphana, an emerging model sea anemone.

Comparative analysis of expression profiles under multiple conditions highlighted candidate genes potentially important in the symbiotic state transition under heat-induced bleaching.

Symbiont algal genes differentially expressed in hospite encode proteins related to heat shock response, calcium signaling, organellar protein transport, and sugar metabolism. Our data suggest that heat stress alters gene expression in both the hosts and symbionts.

A strategy to trigger the production of this biosynthetic potential is to challenge the microorganism with low concentrations of antibiotics, and by using a Burkholderia genetic reporter strain (Seyedsayamdost, Proc Natl Acad Sci 111:7266-7271), we found BGC unsilencing activity for the antimicrobial andrimid, produced by the marine bacterium Vibrio coralliilyticus. Next, we challenged another marine Vibrionaceae, Photobacterium galatheae, carrier of seven orphan BGCs with sub-inhibitory concentrations of andrimid. A combined approach of transcriptional and chemical measurements of andrimid-treated P. galatheae cultures revealed a 10-fold upregulation of an orphan BGC and, amongst others, a 1.6-2.2-fold upregulation of the gene encoding the core enzyme for biosynthesis of holomycin. Also, addition of andrimid caused an increase, based on UV-Vis peak area, of 4-fold in production of the antibiotic holomycin. Transcriptional measurements of stress response related genes in P. galatheae showed a co-occurrence of increased transcript levels of rpoS (general stress response) and andrimid induced holomycin overproduction, while in trimethoprim treated cultures attenuation of holomycin production coincided with a transcriptional increase of recA (SOS stress response). This study shows that using antimicrobial compounds as activators of secondary metabolism can be a useful strategy in eliciting biosynthetic gene clusters and facilitate natural product discovery. Potentially, such interactions could also have ecological relevant implications.","1664-302X","",NA,"22-Dec",2020,11,"",NA,"","622055","10.3389/fmicb.2020.622055",NA,"","WOS:000604594800001",33424823,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

One such new target is the quorum sensing (QS) system. Coral microbial consortia harbor an enormous diversity of microbes, and are thus rich sources for isolating novel bioactive and pharmacologically valuable natural products. However, to date, the versatility of their bioactive compounds has not been broadly explored. In this study, about two hundred bacterial colonies were isolated from a coral species (Pocillopora damicornis) and screened for their ability to inhibit QS using the bioreporter strain Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472. Approximately 15% (30 isolates) exhibited anti-QS activity, against the indicator strain. Among them, a typical Gram-positive bacterium, D11 (Staphylococcus hominis) was identified and its anti-QS activity was investigated. Confocal microscopy observations showed that the bacterial extract inhibited the biofilm formation of clinical isolates of wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 in a dose-dependent pattern. Chromatographic separation led to the isolation of a potent QS inhibitor that was identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as DL-homocysteine thiolactone. Gene expression analyses using RT-PCR showed that strain D11 led to a significant down-regulation of QS regulatory genes (lasI, lasR, rhlI, and rhlR), as well as a virulence-related gene (lasB). From the chemical structure, the target compound (DL-homocysteine thiolactone) is an analog of the acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), and we presume that DL-homocysteine thiolactone outcompetes AHL in occupying the receptor and thereby inhibiting QS. Whole-genome sequence analysis of S. hominis D11 revealed the presence of predicted genes involved in the biosynthesis of homocysteine thiolactone. This study indicates that coral microbes are a resource bank for developing QS inhibitors and they will facilitate the discovery of new biotechnologically relevant compounds that could be used instead of traditional antibiotics.","2235-2988","",NA,"8-May",2018,8,"",NA,"","144","10.3389/fcimb.2018.00144",NA,"","WOS:000431686600001",29868500,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

High DOC concentrations on coral reefs are also hypothesized to be a determinant for switching microbial lifestyles from commensal to pathogenic, thereby contributing to coral reef degradation, but evidence is missing. In this study, we conducted ex situ incubations to assess gene expression of planktonic microbial populations under elevated concentrations of naturally abundant monosaccharides (glucose, galactose, mannose, and xylose) in algal exudates and sewage inflows. We assembled 27 near-complete (470%) microbial genomes through metagenomic sequencing and determined associated expression patterns through metatranscriptomic sequencing. Differential gene expression analysis revealed a shift in the central carbohydrate metabolism and the induction of metalloproteases, siderophores, and toxins in Alteromonas, Erythrobacter, Oceanicola, and Alcanivorax populations. Sugar-specific induction of virulence factors suggests a mechanistic link for the switch from a commensal to a pathogenic lifestyle, particularly relevant during increased algal cover and human-derived pollution on coral reefs.

The Fungiidae exhibited low diazotroph abundance (based on nifH gene copy numbers) and activity (based on nifH gene expression and the absence of detectable nitrogen fixation rates). In contrast, the mostly autotrophic Pocilloporidae exhibited nifH gene copy numbers and gene expression two orders of magnitude higher than in the Fungiidae, which coincided with detectable nitrogen fixation activity. Based on these data, we suggest that nitrogen fixation compensates for the low heterotrophic nitrogen uptake in autotrophic corals.

The purpose of the present study was to determine how chitin affects the transcriptome and metabolome of two bioactive Vibrionaceae strains, Vibrio coralliilyticus and Photobacterium galatheae. We focused on chitin degradation genes and secondary metabolites based on the assumption that these molecules in nature confer an advantage to the producer. Growth on chitin caused upregulation of genes related to chitin metabolism and of genes potentially involved in host colonization and/or infection. The expression of genes involved in secondary metabolism was also significantly affected by growth on chitin, in one case being 34-fold upregulated. This was reflected in the metabolome, where the antibiotics andrimid and holomycin were produced in larger amounts on chitin. Other polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) clusters in P. galatheae were also strongly upregulated on chitin. Collectively, this suggests that both V. coralliilyticus and P. galatheae have a specific lifestyle for growth on chitin and that their secondary metabolites likely play a crucial role during chitin colonization. IMPORTANCE The bacterial family Vibrionaceae (vibrios) is considered a major player in the degradation of chitin, the most abundant polymer in the marine environment; however, the majority of studies on the topic have focused on a small number of Vibrio species. In this study, we analyzed the genomes of two vibrios to assess their genetic potential for the degradation of chitin. We then used transcriptomics and metabolomics to demonstrate that chitin strongly affects these vibrios at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels.

Therefore, we used the Illumina RNAseq approach to study the effects of acute exposure to elevated CO2 on gene expression in primary polyps of Acropora millepora, using as reference a novel comprehensive transcriptome assembly developed for this study. Gene ontology analysis of this whole transcriptome data set indicated that CO2-driven acidification strongly suppressed metabolism but enhanced extracellular organic matrix synthesis, whereas targeted analyses revealed complex effects on genes implicated in calcification. Unexpectedly, expression of most ion transport proteins was unaffected, while many membrane-associated or secreted carbonic anhydrases were expressed at lower levels.

At the organismal level, no significant differences were detected in the calcification and respiration rates of D. dianthus. Conversely, significant differences were recorded in gene expression profiles, which showed an up-regulation of genes involved in cellular stress (HSP70) and immune defence (mannose-binding c-type lectin). Expression of alpha-carbonic anhydrase, a key enzyme involved in the synthesis of coral skeleton, was also significantly up-regulated in corals under elevated pCO(2), indicating that D. dianthus was under physiological reconditioning to calcify under these conditions. Thus, gene expression profiles revealed physiological impacts that were not evident at the organismal level.

Although subtle, this decreasing pH has profound effects on the seawater saturation state of carbonate minerals and is thus predicted to impact on calcifying organisms. Among these are the scleractinian corals, which are the main builders of tropical coral reefs. Several recent studies have evaluated the physiological impact of low pH, particularly in relation to coral growth and calcification. However, very few studies have focused on the impact of low pH at the global molecular level. In this context we investigated global transcriptomic modifications in a scleractinian coral (Pocillopora damicornis) exposed to pH 7.4 compared to pH 8.1 during a 3-week period. The RNAseq approach shows that 16% of our transcriptome was affected by the treatment with 6% of upregulations and 10% of downregulations. A more detailed analysis suggests that the downregulations are less coordinated than the upregulations and allowed the identification of several biological functions of interest. In order to better understand the links between these functions and the pH, transcript abundance of 48 candidate genes was quantified by q-RT-PCR (corals exposed at pH 7.2 and 7.8 for 3 weeks). The combined results of these two approaches suggest that pH >= 7.4 induces an upregulation of genes coding for proteins involved in calcium and carbonate transport, conversion of CO2 into HCO3- and organic matrix that may sustain calcification. Concomitantly, genes coding for heterotrophic and autotrophic related proteins are upregulated. This can reflect that low pH may increase the coral energy requirements, leading to an increase of energetic metabolism with the mobilization of energy reserves. In addition, the uncoordinated downregulations measured can reflect a general trade-off mechanism that may enable energy reallocation.","1932-6203","",NA,"27-Mar",2013,8,"3",NA,"","e58652","10.1371/journal.pone.0058652",NA,"","WOS:000317480700008",23544045,NA,NA,NA,NA,"acidification",1,"none",1

In the present study, we examined the effects of acidified seawater on the larvae of Acropora digitifera at the molecular level. We targeted two heat shock proteins, Hsp70 and Hsp90, and a heat shock transcription factor, Hsf1, because of their importance in stress responses and in early life developmental stages. Coral larvae were maintained under the ambient and elevated CO2 conditions that are expected to occur within next 100 years, and then we evaluated the expression of hsps and hsf1 by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Expression levels of these molecules significantly differed among target genes, but they did not change significantly between CO2 conditions. These findings indicate that the expression of hsps is not changed due to external pH changes, and suggest that tolerance to acidified seawater in coral larvae may not be related to hsp expression.

In order to understand the mechanism(s) of resistance in this coral, we present the results of a thermal stress and ocean acidification (OA) experiment on M. cavemosa, both its brown and orange color morphs, representing conditions predicted by the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 6.0 scenario in the year 2100. We assessed the community response of the prokaryotic microbiome, the photophysiological response of the endosymbiotic Symbiodiniaceae and the molecular responses of critical pathways in the host by quantifying transcript abundances of genes encoding fluorescent proteins, heat shock proteins, antioxidant enzymes and regulators of apoptosis. After a 12 d acclimatization experiment, no visible bleaching was observed in any treatment, and the excitation pressure on photosystem II of the symbiotic Symbiodiniaceae showed no effects of the independent or interactive effects of thermal stress and OA, while only minor, but significant, changes in the prokaryotic microbiome were observed when exposed to RCP 6.0 predicted OA conditions. At the end of the experiment, the host heat shock protein 90 showed an increase in transcript abundance under the combined effects of thermal stress and OA compared to high temperatures alone, but these treatment groups were not significantly different from treatments under normal temperatures. While Bax, an activator of apoptosis, was significantly higher under thermal stress alone compared to control samples. Taken together, M. cavemosa, exhibits ecological stability over time and this may be based on its physiological persistence, resistance and resilience when experimentally exposed to the ecologically realistic RCP 6.0 climate model predictions.","","2296-7745",NA,"16-Sep",2020,7,"",NA,"","728","10.3389/fmars.2020.00728",NA,"","WOS:000573895200001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"acidification",1,"none",1

Of specific interest are the links between biomineralization proteins and the precipitation of new calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which potentially can provide a better understanding of the biomineralization process. We have assessed the effects of increased CO2 on the calcification process in cell cultures of the stony coral, Stylophora pistillata, reared in nutrient-enriched artificial seawater at four pCO(2) levels and two glucose concentrations. Dispersed S. pistillata cells grown at low (400 ppmV) and moderate (700 ppmV) pCO(2) re-aggregate into proto-polyps and precipitate CaCO3. When grown at pCO(2) levels of 1000 ppmV and 2000 ppmV, the cells up-regulate genes for two highly acidic proteins as well as a carbonic anhydrase, but down-regulate long term cadherin protein production and minimize proto-polyp formation, and exhibit a significant decrease in measurable CaCO3 precipitation. However, cell cultures precipitate CaCO3 in all treatments, even at slightly undersaturated conditions (Omega(aragonite)< 0.95). Glucose addition does not influence either biomineralization gene expression or calcification rate. Measured delta B-11 of the mineral phase, as a proxy of the pH at the calcifying sites, is out of equilibrium with the ambient seawater medium surrounding the cells and proto-polyps, suggesting pH is elevated in the micro-environment of the precipitating mineral.

By identifying locally adapted populations, researchers can examine the mechanisms used to cope with decreasing pH. One oceanographic process that influences pH is wind-driven upwelling. Here we compare two Californian populations of the coral Balanophyllia elegans from distinct upwelling regimes, and test their physiological and transcriptomic responses to experimental seawater acidification. We measured respiration rates, protein and lipid content, and gene expression in corals from both populations exposed to pH levels of 7.8 and 7.4 for 29 days. Corals from the population that experiences lower pH due to high upwelling maintained the same respiration rate throughout the exposure. In contrast, corals from the low upwelling site had reduced respiration rates, protein content and lipid-class content at low pH exposure, suggesting they have depleted their energy reserves. Using RNA-Seq, we found that corals from the high upwelling site upregulated genes involved in calcium ion binding and ion transport, most likely related to pH homeostasis and calcification. In contrast, corals from the low upwelling site downregulated stress response genes at low pH exposure.

We found that both light and dark calcification rates of Sesoko corals did not change with an increase in seawater pCO(2), while the calcification rates of Bise corals significantly decreased. Additionally, calcification rate of Sesoko corals was significantly lower than Bise corals at control conditions. Expressions of two putative calcification-related genes (BAT: bicarbonate transporter and galaxin) were up-regulated at high CO2 compared to the control and expression of the BAT gene was significantly higher in Sesoko compared to Bise corals. Consequently, differences in the calcification rate between populations and differences in the expression of genes related to inorganic carbon transport regulation could be reasons that explain the difference in the response to OA between the two populations. Furthermore, taking into account that Sesoko corals were located in relatively nearshore areas where the environmental conditions are more variable, while Bise corals were located in the forereef which shows more stable conditions, plasticity for coral calcification in response to different environmental conditions and/or acclimation response to changes such as seawater pCO(2) may lead to differences in sensitivity between the two populations to high seawater pCO(2).

Here we explore growth and the expression of 20 target genes with putative roles in metabolism and calcification in the branching coral, Acropora millepora, in two separate experiments: 1) elevated pCO(2) (464, 822, 1187 and 1638 mu atm) and ambient temperature (27 degrees C), and 2) elevated pCO(2) (490 and 822 mu atm) and temperature (28 and 31 degrees C). After 14 days of exposure to elevated pCO(2) and ambient temperatures, no evidence of differential expression of either calcification or metabolism genes was detected between control and elevated pCO(2) treatments. After 37 days of exposure to control and elevated pCO(2), Ubiquinol-Cytochrome-C Reductase Subunit 2 gene (QCR2; a gene involved in complex III of the electron chain transport within the mitochondria and critical for generation of ATP) was significantly down-regulated in the elevated pCO(2) treatment in both ambient and elevated temperature treatments. Overall, the general absence of a strong response to elevated pCO(2) and temperature by the other 19 targeted calcification and metabolism genes suggests that corals may not be affected by these stressors on longer time scales (37 days).

The colony from which the fragments were sampled explained most of the variance in expression patterns, but a general pattern emerged where upregulation of ion transport, required to maintain normal function and calcification, was coincident with lowered expression of genes involved in metabolic processes; RNA regulation and processing in particular. Furthermore, there was no differential expression of carbonic anhydrase detected in any analyses, which agrees with a previously described lack of response in enzyme activity in the same corals. However, one colony was able to maintain calcification longer than the other colonies when exposed to low pH and showed increased expression of ion transport genes including proton transport and expression of genes associated with formation of microtubules and the organic matrix, suggesting that certain genotypes may be better equipped to cope with ocean acidification in the future.

The only previous whole-transcriptome study (Moya etal. Molecular Ecology, 2012; 21, 2440) documented extensive disruption of gene expression, particularly of genes encoding skeletal organic matrix proteins, in juvenile corals (Acropora millepora) after short-term (3d) exposure to elevated pCO(2). In this study, whole-transcriptome analysis was used to compare the effects of such acute' (3d) exposure to elevated pCO(2) with a longer (prolonged'; 9d) period of exposure beginning immediately post-fertilization. Far fewer genes were differentially expressed under the 9-d treatment, and although the transcriptome data implied wholesale disruption of metabolism and calcification genes in the acute treatment experiment, expression of most genes was at control levels after prolonged treatment. There was little overlap between the genes responding to the acute and prolonged treatments, but heat shock proteins (HSPs) and heat shock factors (HSFs) were over-represented amongst the genes responding to both treatments. Amongst these was an HSP70 gene previously shown to be involved in acclimation to thermal stress in a field population of another acroporid coral. The most obvious feature of the molecular response in the 9-d treatment experiment was the upregulation of five distinct Bcl-2 family members, the majority predicted to be anti-apoptotic. This suggests that an important component of the longer term response to elevated CO2 is suppression of apoptosis. It therefore appears that juvenile A.millepora have the capacity to rapidly acclimate to elevated pCO(2), a process mediated by upregulation of specific HSPs and a suite of Bcl-2 family members.","0962-1083","1365-294X",NA,"JAN",2015,24,"2",438,"452","","10.1111/mec.13021",NA,"","WOS:000348061600013",25444080,NA,NA,NA,NA,"acidification",1,"none",1

Identification of gene expression changes within corals in response to contact with macroalgae can provide insight into the mode of action of allelochemicals, as well as reveal transcriptional strategies of the coral that mitigate damage from this competitive interaction, enabling the coral to survive. Gene expression responses of the coral Acropora millepora after long-term (20 days) direct contact with macroalgae (Chlorodesmis fastigiata, Dictyota bartayresiana, Galaxaura filamentosa, and Turbinaria conoides) and short-term (1 and 24 h) exposure to C. fastigiata thalli and their hydrophobic extract were assessed. After 20 days of exposure, T. conoides thalli elicited no significant change in visual bleaching or zooxanthellae PSII quantum yield within A. millepora nubbins, but stimulated the greatest alteration in gene expression of all treatments. Chlorodesmis fastigiata, D. bartayresiana, and G. filamentosa caused significant visual bleaching of coral nubbins and reduced the PSII quantum yield of associated zooxanthellae after 20 days, but elicited fewer changes in gene expression relative to T. conoides at day 20. To evaluate initial molecular processes leading to reduction of zooxanthella PSII quantum yield, visual bleaching, and coral death, short-term exposures to C. fastigiata thalli and hydrophobic extracts were conducted; these interactions revealed protein degradation and significant changes in catalytic and metabolic activity within 24 h of contact. These molecular responses are consistent with the hypothesis that allelopathic interactions lead to alteration of signal transduction and an imbalance between reactive oxidant species production and antioxidant capabilities within the coral holobiont. This oxidative imbalance results in rapid protein degradation and eventually to apoptosis and/or necrosis when compensatory transcriptional action by the coral holobiont insufficiently mitigates damage by the allelochemicals of C. fastigiata.","0722-4028","1432-0975",NA,"DEC",2012,31,"4",1177,"1192","","10.1007/s00338-012-0943-7",NA,"","WOS:000310999300029",23997654,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

Due to increasing anthropogenic stresses, coral reefs are in decline. Along the coast of Okinawa, Japan, three different color morphs of Acropora tenuis have been recognized for decades. These include brown (N morph), yellow green (G), and purple (P) forms. The tips of axial polyps of each morph exhibit specific fluorescence spectra. This attribute is inherited asexually, and color morphs do not change seasonally. In Okinawa Prefecture, during the summer of 2017, N and P morphs experienced bleaching, in which many N morphs died. Dinoflagellates (Symbiodiniaceae) are essential partners of scleractinian corals, and photosynthetic activity of symbionts was reduced in N and P morphs. In contrast, G morphs successfully withstood the stress. Examination of the Glade and type of Symbiodiniaceae indicated that the three color-morphs host similar sets of Clade-C symbionts, suggesting that beaching of N and P morphs is unlikely attributable to differences in the Glade of Symbiodiniaceae the color morphs hosted. Fluorescent proteins play pivotal roles in physiological regulation of corals. Since the A. tenuis genome has been decoded, we identified five genes for green fluorescent proteins (GFPs), two for cyan fluorescent proteins (CFPs), three for red fluorescent proteins (RFPs), and seven genes for chromoprotein (ChrP). A summer survey of gene expression profiles under outdoor aquarium conditions demonstrated that (a) expression of CFP and REP was quite low during the summer in all three morphs, (b) P morphs expressed higher levels of ChrP than N and G morphs, (c) both N and G morphs expressed GFP more highly than P morphs, and (d) GFP expression in N morphs was reduced during summer whereas G morphs maintained high levels of GFP expression throughout the summer. Although further studies are required to understand the biological significance of these color morphs of A. tenuis, our results suggest that thermal stress resistance is modified by genetic mechanisms that coincidentally lead to diversification of color morphs of this coral.","2160-1836","",NA,"FEB",2021,11,"2",NA,"","jkab018","10.1093/g3journal/jkab018",NA,"","WOS:000651850600047",33621334,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

To incorporate genotypic variation into the investigation of coral competitive interactions, we used RNA-sequencing to study changes in gene expression in a hard coral (Porites cylindrica) resulting from non-contact competition experiment with a soft coral (Lobophytum pauciflorum). Hard coral genotype explained the largest proportion of variation between samples; however, it was also possible to detect gene expression changes in 76 transcripts resulting from interaction with the soft coral. In addition, we found a group of 20 short secreted proteins that were expressed as a coordinated unit in three interacting Porites-Lobophytum pairs.

In order to investigate the evolution of coral biomineralization, we have identified skeletal organic matrix proteins (SOMPs) in the skeletal proteome of the scleractinian coral, Acropora digitifera, for which large genomic and transcriptomic datasets are available. Scrupulous gene annotation was conducted based on comparisons of functional domain structures among metazoans. We found that SOMPs include not only coral-specific proteins, but also protein families that are widely conserved among cnidarians and other metazoans. We also identified several conserved transmembrane proteins in the skeletal proteome. Gene expression analysis revealed that expression of these conserved genes continues throughout development. Therefore, these genes are involved not only skeleton formation, but also in basic cellular functions, such as cell-cell interaction and signaling. On the other hand, genes encoding coral-specific proteins, including extracellular matrix domain-containing proteins, galaxins, and acidic proteins, were prominently expressed in post-settlement stages, indicating their role in skeleton formation. Taken together, the process of coral skeleton formation is hypothesized as: 1) formation of initial extracellular matrix between epithelial cells and substrate, employing pre-existing transmembrane proteins; 2) additional extracellular matrix formation using novel proteins that have emerged by domain shuffling and rapid molecular evolution and; 3) calcification controlled by coral-specific SOMPs.","1932-6203","",NA,"2-Jun",2016,11,"6",NA,"","e0156424","10.1371/journal.pone.0156424",NA,"","WOS:000377218700029",27253604,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

Reproductive biology and the evolutionary constraints acting on dispersal stages are poorly understood in many stony coral species. A key piece of missing information is egg and sperm gene expression. This is critical for broadcast spawning corals, such as our model, the Hawaiian species Montipora capitata, because eggs and sperm are exposed to environmental stressors during dispersal. Furthermore, parental effects such as transcriptome investment may provide a means for cross- or trans-generational plasticity and be apparent in egg and sperm transcriptome data. Methods. Here, we analyzed M. capitata egg and sperm transcriptomic data to address three questions: (1) Which pathways and functions are actively transcribed in these gametes? (2) How does sperm and egg gene expression differ from adult tissues? (3) Does gene expression differ between these gametes? Results. We show that egg and sperm display surprisingly similar levels of gene expression and overlapping functional enrichment patterns. These results may reflect similar environmental constraints faced by these motile gametes. We find significant differences in differential expression of egg vs. adult and sperm vs. adult RNA-seq data, in contrast to very few examples of differential expression when comparing egg vs. sperm transcriptomes. Lastly, using gene ontology and KEGG orthology data we show that both egg and sperm have markedly repressed transcription and translation machinery compared to the adult, suggesting a dependence on parental transcripts.

Although cell renewal, differentiation, and maintenance of pluripotency are cellular events shared by multicellular animals, the cellular basis of these fundamental biological processes are still poorly understood. To understand how changes in gene expression regulate morphogenetic transitions at the base of the eumetazoa, we performed quantitative RNA-seq analysis during Acropora digitifera's development. We collected embryonic, larval, and adult samples to characterize stage-specific transcription profiles, as well as broad expression patterns. Transcription profiles reconstructed development revealing two main expression clusters. The first cluster grouped blastula and gastrula and the second grouped subsequent developmental time points. Consistently, we observed clear differences in gene expression between early and late developmental transitions, with higher numbers of differentially expressed genes and fold changes around gastrulation. Furthermore, we identified three coexpression clusters that represented discrete gene expression patterns. During early transitions, transcriptional networks seemed to regulate cellular fate and morphogenesis of the larval body. In late transitions, these networks seemed to play important roles preparing planulae for switch in lifestyle and regulation of adult processes. Although developmental progression in A. digitifera is regulated to some extent by differential coexpression of well-defined gene networks, stage-specific transcription profiles appear to be independent entities.

As major components of tropical reef ecosystems, the stony corals are anthozoans of particular ecological significance. To better understand the molecular bases of both cnidarian development in general and coral-specific processes such as skeletogenesis and symbiont acquisition, microarray analysis was carried out through the period of early development - when skeletogenesis is initiated, and symbionts are first acquired. Results: Of 5081 unique peptide coding genes, 1084 were differentially expressed (P <= 0.05) in comparisons between four different stages of coral development, spanning key developmental transitions. Genes of likely relevance to the processes of settlement, metamorphosis, calcification and interaction with symbionts were characterised further and their spatial expression patterns investigated using whole-mount in situ hybridization. Conclusion: This study is the first large-scale investigation of developmental gene expression for any cnidarian, and has provided candidate genes for key roles in many aspects of coral biology, including calcification, metamorphosis and symbiont uptake. One surprising finding is that some of these genes have clear counterparts in higher animals but are not present in the closely-related sea anemone Nematostella. Secondly, coral-specific processes (i.e. traits which distinguish corals from their close relatives) may be analogous to similar processes in distantly related organisms. This first large-scale application of microarray analysis demonstrates the potential of this approach for investigating many aspects of coral biology, including the effects of stress and disease.","1471-2164","",NA,"14-Nov",2008,9,"",NA,"","540","10.1186/1471-2164-9-540",NA,"","WOS:000263107400001",19014561,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

Its role in mesoderm formation has been intensively studied in vertebrates [3-6]. However, its fundamental function near the blastopore is poorly understood in other phyla. Cnidarians are basal metazoans that are important for understanding evolution of metazoan body plans [7, 8]. Because they lack mesoderm, they have been used to investigate the evolutionary origins of mesoderm [1, 9-11]. Here, we focus on corals, a primitive Glade of cnidarians that diverged from sea anemones-500 mya [12]. We developed a microinjection method for coral eggs to examine Brachyury functions during embryogenesis of the scleractinian coral, Acropora digitifera. Because Acropora embryos undergo pharynx formation after the blastopore closes completely [13-15], they are useful to understand Brachyury functions in gastrulation movement and pharynx formation. We show that blastoporal expression of brachyury is directly activated by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the ectoderm of coral embryos, indicating that the regulatory axis from Wnt/beta-catenin signaling to brachyury is highly conserved among eumetazoans. Loss-of-function analysis demonstrated that Brachyury is required for pharynx formation but not for gastrulation movement. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis demonstrated that genes positively regulated by Brachyury are expressed in the ectoderm of Acropora gastrulae, while negatively regulated genes are in endoderm. Therefore, germ layer demarcation around the blastopore appears to be the evolutionarily conserved role of Brachyury during gastrulation. Compared with Brachyury functions in vertebrate mesoderm-ectoderm and mesoderm-endoderm demarcation [4-6], our results suggest that the vertebrate-type mesoderm may have originated from brachyury-expressing ectoderm adjacent to endoderm.","0960-9822","1879-0445",NA,"7-Nov",2016,26,"21",2885,"2892","","10.1016/j.cub.2016.08.011",NA,"","WOS:000387835700023",27693135,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

However, in contrast to the situation in other animals, e. g., frogs and insects, little is known about the molecular basis of coral metamorphosis. We have begun to redress this situation with previous microarray studies, but there is still a great deal to learn. In the present paper we have utilized a different technology, subtractive hybridization, to characterize genes differentially expressed across this developmental transition and to compare the success of this method to microarray. Methodology/Principal Findings: Suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to identify two pools of transcripts from the coral, Acropora millepora. One is enriched for transcripts expressed at higher levels at the pre-settlement stage, and the other for transcripts expressed at higher levels at the post-settlement stage. Virtual northern blots were used to demonstrate the efficacy of the subtractive hybridization technique. Both pools contain transcripts coding for proteins in various functional classes but transcriptional regulatory proteins were represented more frequently in the post-settlement pool. Approximately 18% of the transcripts showed no significant similarity to any other sequence on the public databases. Transcripts of particular interest were further characterized by in situ hybridization, which showed that many are regulated spatially as well as temporally. Notably, many transcripts exhibit axially restricted expression patterns that correlate with the pool from which they were isolated. Several transcripts are expressed in patterns consistent with a role in calcification. Conclusions: We have characterized over 200 transcripts that are differentially expressed between the planula larva and post-settlement polyp of the coral, Acropora millepora.

They live in tropical waters around the globe where they are frequently exposed to potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation (UVR). The eggs and early embryonic stages of some coral species are highly buoyant and remain near the sea surface for prolonged periods of time and may therefore be the most sensitive life stages with respect to UVR. Here, we analysed gene expression changes in five developmental stages of the Caribbean coral Montastraea faveolata to natural levels of UVR using high-density cDNA microarrays (10 930 clones). We found that larvae exhibit low sensitivity to natural levels of UVR during early development as reflected by comparatively few transcriptomic changes in response to UVR. However, we identified a time window of high UVR sensitivity that coincides with the motile planula stage and the onset of larval competence. These processes have been shown to be affected by UVR exposure, and the transcriptional changes we identified explain these observations well. Our analysis of differentially expressed genes indicates that UVR alters the expression of genes associated with stress response, the endoplasmic reticulum, Ca2+ homoeostasis, development and apoptosis during the motile planula stage and affects the expression of neurogenesis-related genes that are linked to swimming and settlement behaviour at later stages. Taken together, our study provides further data on the impact of natural levels of UVR on coral larvae. Furthermore, our results might allow a better prediction of settlement and recruitment rates after coral spawning events if UVR climate data are taken into account.","0962-1083","1365-294X",NA,"JUL",2011,20,"14",2955,"2972","","10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05153.x",NA,"","WOS:000292445700009",21689186,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UVR",1,"none",1

Nevertheless, this question is also of great importance for understanding the evolution of species in a context of climate change. The red coral (Corallium rubrum) lives in the Mediterranean Sea, where at depths ranging from 5 to 600m, it meets very contrasted thermal conditions. The shallowest populations of this species suffered from mortality events linked with thermal anomalies that have highlighted thermotolerance differences between individuals. We provide here a new transcriptomic resource, as well as candidate markers for the study of local adaptation. We sequenced the transcriptome of six individuals from 5m and six individuals from 40m depth at the same site of the Marseilles bay, after a period of common garden acclimatization. We found differential expression maintained between the two depths even after common garden acclimatization, and we analysed the polymorphism pattern of these samples. We highlighted contigs potentially implicated in the response to thermal stress, which could be good candidates for the study of thermal adaptation for the red coral.

The diverse ecosystem of coral reefs, for example, are globally threatened by increases in sea surface temperatures due to global warming. Studies to date have focused on determining genetic diversity, the sequence variability of genes in a species, as a proxy to estimate and predict the potential adaptive response of coral populations to environmental changes linked to climate changes. However, the examination of natural gene expression variation has received less attention. This variation has been implicated as an important factor in evolutionary processes, upon which natural selection can act. Results: We acclimatized coral nubbins from six colonies of the reef-building coral Acropora millepora to a common garden in Heron Island (Great Barrier Reef, GBR) for a period of four weeks to remove any site-specific environmental effects on the physiology of the coral nubbins. By using a cDNA microarray platform, we detected a high level of gene expression variation, with 17% (488) of the unigenes differentially expressed across coral nubbins of the six colonies (jsFDR-corrected, p < 0.01). Among the main categories of biological processes found differentially expressed were transport, translation, response to stimulus, oxidation-reduction processes, and apoptosis. We found that the transcriptional profiles did not correspond to the genotype of the colony characterized using either an intron of the carbonic anhydrase gene or microsatellite loci markers. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence of the high inter-colony variation in A. millepora at the transcriptomic level grown under a common garden and without a correspondence with genotypic identity. This finding brings to our attention the importance of taking into account natural variation between reef corals when assessing experimental gene expression differences.

Here we studied skeletal modifications of Stylophora pistillata (clade 4) colonies that adapt to increasing depths with decreasing ambient light. The coral show characteristic transitions from spherical morphologies (shallow depths, 5 m deep) to flat and branching geometries (mesophotic depths, 60 m deep). Such changes are typically ascribed to the algal photosymbiont physiological feedback with the coral that host them. We find specific fine-scale skeletal variability in accretion of structure at shallowand mesophotic depth morphotypes that suggest underlying genomic regulation of biomineralization pathways of the coral host. To explain this, we conducted comparative morphology-based analyses, including optical and electron microscopy, tomography and X-ray diffraction analysis coupled with a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of S. pistillata. The samples originated from Gulf of Eilat in the Red Sea collected along a depth gradient from shallow to mesophotic depths (5 to 60 m). Additional samples were experimentally transplanted from 5 m to 60 m and from 60 m to 5 m. Interestingly, both morphologically and functionally, transplanted corals partly adapt by exhibiting typical depth-specific properties. In mesophotic depths, we find that the organic matrix fraction is enriched in the coralla, well matching the overrepresentation of transcripts encoding biomineralization ""tool-kit"" structural extracellularproteins that was observed. These results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of calcification and skeletal adaptation that repeatedly allowed this coral group to adapt to a range of environments presumably with a rich geological past. Statement of Significance Understanding the reef coral physiological plasticity under a rapidly changing climate is of crucial importance for the protection of coral reef ecosystems. Most of the reef corals operate near their upper limit of heat tolerance. A possible rescue for some coral species is migration to deeper, cooler mesophotic depths. However, gradually changing environmental parameters (especially light) along the depth gradient pose new adaptative stress on corals with largely unknown influences on the various biological molecular pathways.

KEGG function enrichment analysis revealed that P. damicornis from the high-temperature pool had a lower metabolic rate than that from the low-temperature pool. We hypothesize that metabolic readjustment, in the form of a lower metabolic rate, positively correlated with increased heat tolerance in P. damicornis in thermally variable reef environments.

Whether corals can adapt to increasing temperatures over the course of generations will depend in part on heritable variation in thermal physiology and dispersal potential, which may serve as the raw material for natural selection. To investigate whether such variation exists in coral populations, and build a framework for identifying the coral-specific genetic factors involved, we performed controlled crosses between 3 genetically distinct colonies of the branching coral Acropora millepora. We compared the families of larvae (which in this species naturally lack symbionts) for several physiological traits, and observed between-family differences in nearly every case. Using larvae cultured at standard and elevated temperatures, we measured the developmental decrease in protein content and the expression of candidate heat response genes. We used an in vivo assay for mitochondrial enzyme activity to evaluate the metabolic response to temperature changes in individual larvae. We also compared the responsiveness of larvae from different families to a natural settlement cue to gain insights into long-range dispersal potential. Partitioning the components of total phenotypic variance confirmed the existence of additive genetic effects for settlement rates and beta gamma-crystallin expression, while variance in mitochondrial Q(10) and the expression of actin and Hsp16 were driven by non-additive effects. The phenotypic variance observed among the small number of families analyzed here suggests the existence of considerable heritable variation in natural coral populations, which supports the possibility of effective adaptive responses to climate change.","0171-8630","1616-1599",NA,"",2009,392,"",81,"92","","10.3354/meps08208",NA,"","WOS:000271828700007",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1

The relative Hsp70 levels varied significantly between colonies from the two different locations, colonies having different health conditions and the year of collection.

No significant genetic differentiation between the two studied coral populations was observed and all the colonies analysed were associated with Symbiodiniaceae of the genusSymbiodinium(Clade A) irrespective of location and sampling period. These findings provide further evidence of the involvement of Hsp70 in conferring bleaching tolerance to corals.

As anthropogenic and natural stressors are contributing to a global decline of coral reefs, understanding coral health is critical to help preserve these ecosystems. Growth anomaly (GA) is a coral disease that has significant negative impacts on coral biology, yet our understanding of its etiology and pathology is lacking. In this study we used RNA-seq along with de novo metatranscriptome assembly and homology assignment to identify coral genes that are expressed in three distinct coral tissue types: tissue from healthy corals (""healthy""), GA lesion tissue from diseased corals (""GA-affected"") and apparently healthy tissue from diseased corals (""GA-unaffected""). We conducted pairwise comparisons of gene expression among these three tissue types to identify genes and pathways that help us to unravel the molecular pathology of this coral disease. Results: The quality-filtered de novo-assembled metatranscriptome contained 76,063 genes, of which 13,643 were identified as putative coral genes. Overall gene expression profiles of coral genes revealed high similarity between healthy tissue samples, in contrast to high variance among diseased samples. This indicates GA has a variety of genetic effects at the colony level, including on seemingly healthy (GA-unaffected) tissue. A total of 105 unique coral genes were found differentially expressed among tissue types. Pairwise comparisons revealed the greatest number of differentially expressed genes between healthy and GA-affected tissue (93 genes), followed by healthy and GA-unaffected tissue (33 genes), and GA-affected and -unaffected tissue (7 genes). The putative function of these genes suggests GA is associated with changes in the activity of genes involved in developmental processes and activation of the immune system. Conclusion: This is one of the first transcriptome-level studies to investigate coral GA, and the first metatranscriptome assembly for the M. capitata holobiont. The gene expression data, metatranscriptome assembly and methodology developed through this study represent a significant addition to the molecular information available to further our understanding of this coral disease.","1471-2164","",NA,"11-Sep",2017,18,"",NA,"","710","10.1186/s12864-017-4090-y",NA,"","WOS:000410063800001",28893194,NA,NA,NA,NA,"growth anomaly",1,"none",1

Transcript abundances of the 5 target genes in healthy tissue, GA-affected tissue, and unaffected tissue (apparently healthy tissue adjacent to GA) relative to 3 internal control genes (actin, NADH, and rpS3) were compared using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. Galaxin, which codes for a protein suspected to be involved in calcification and thus hypothesized to be differentially expressed in GA, was up-regulated in unaffected tissue but remained at baseline levels in GA tissue. The gene expressions of murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) remained unchanged in GA tissue. The expression of tyrosine protein kinase (TPK) and beta gamma-crystallin (BGC) were both down-regulated. These expression patterns were all inconsistent with the expression patterns of homologous genes in neoplastic diseases featuring similar morphological symptoms in humans.

Overall, diseased O. faveolata had 2194 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared with healthy colonies, whereas diseased M. cavernosa had 582 DEGs compared with healthy colonies. Many significant DEGs were implicated in immunity, extracellular matrix rearrangement, and apoptosis. These included, but not limited to, peroxidases, collagens, Bax-like, fibrinogen-like, protein tyrosine kinase, and transforming growth factor beta. A gene module was identified that was significantly correlated to disease transmission. This module possessed many apoptosis and immune genes with high module membership indicating that a complex apoptosis and immune response is occurring in corals during SCTLD transmission. Overall, we found that O. faveolata and M. cavernosa exhibit an immune, apoptosis, and tissue rearrangement response to SCTLD.

Caribbean Yellow Band Disease (CYBD) is considered a disease of Symbiodinium within the tissues of the coral host Orbicella faveolata. There is a paucity of diagnostic tools to assist in the early detection and characterization of coral diseases. The validity of a diagnostic test is determined by its ability to distinguish host organisms that have the disease from those that do not. The ability to detect and identify disease-affected tissue before visible signs of the disease are evident would then be a useful diagnostic tool for monitoring and managing disease outbreaks. Representational Difference Analysis (RDA) was utilized to isolate differentially expressed genes in O. faveolata exhibiting CYBD. Preliminary screening of RDA products identified a small number of genes of interest (GOI) which included an early growth response factor and ubiquitin ligase from the coral host as well as cytochrome oxidase from the algal symbiont. To further characterize the specificity of response, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was utilized to compare the expression profiles of these GOIs within diseased tissues (visible lesions), tissues that precede visible lesions by 2-4 cm (transition area), and tissues from healthy-looking colonies with no signs of disease. Results show there are distinctive differences in the expression profiles of these three GOIs within each tissue examined.

Here we compared gene expression profiles in eight healthy Acropora hyacinthus colonies against eight colonies exhibiting tissue loss commonly associated with white syndromes, all collected from a natural reef environment near Palau. Two types of tissues were sampled from diseased corals: visibly affected and apparently healthy. Results: Tag-based RNA-Seq followed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified groups of co-regulated differentially expressed genes between all health states (disease lesion, apparently healthy tissues of diseased colonies, and fully healthy). Differences between healthy and diseased tissues indicate activation of several innate immunity and tissue repair pathways accompanied by reduced calcification and the switch towards metabolic reliance on stored lipids. Unaffected parts of diseased colonies, although displaying a trend towards these changes, were not significantly different from fully healthy samples. Still, network analysis identified a group of genes, suggestive of altered immunity state, that were specifically up-regulated in unaffected parts of diseased colonies. Conclusions: Similarity of fully healthy samples to apparently healthy parts of diseased colonies indicates that systemic effects of white syndromes on A. hyacinthus are weak, which implies that the coral colony is largely able to sustain its physiological performance despite disease. The genes specifically up-regulated in unaffected parts of diseased colonies, instead of being the consequence of disease, might be related to the originally higher susceptibility of these colonies to naturally occurring white syndromes.","1471-2164","",NA,"9-May",2015,16,"",NA,"","371","10.1186/s12864-015-1540-2",NA,"","WOS:000354175900005",25956907,NA,NA,NA,NA,"infection status",1,"none",1

The transcriptomic response of the coral to Chromera was complex and implies that host immunity is strongly suppressed, and both phagosome maturation and the apoptotic machinery is modified. These responses differ markedly from those described for infection with a competent strain of the coral mutualist Symbiodinium, instead resembling those of vertebrate hosts to parasites and/or pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Many examples of diurnal cycles of RNA abundance were identified, some of which are light responsive and damped quickly under constant darkness, for example, cryptochrome 1 and timeless, but others that continue to cycle in a robust manner when kept in constant darkness, for example, clock, cryptochrome 2, cycle and eyes absent, indicating that their transcription is regulated by an endogenous clock entrained to the light-dark cycle. Many other biological processes that varied between day and night were also identified by a clustering analysis of gene ontology annotations. Conclusions/Significance: Corals exhibit diurnal patterns of gene expression that may participate in the regulation of circadian biological processes. Rhythmic cycles of gene expression occur under constant darkness in both populations of coral larvae that lack zooxanthellae and in individual adult tissue containing zooxanthellae, indicating that transcription is under the control of a biological clock. In addition to genes potentially involved in regulating circadian processes, many other pathways were found to display diel cycles of transcription.","1932-6203","",NA,"19-Sep",2011,6,"9",NA,"","e25072","10.1371/journal.pone.0025072",NA,"","WOS:000295257900048",21949855,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

We also detected the relative mRNA expression levels of gaCaLP using the calcium channel blocker verapamil and CaCl2 treatment under conditions of light and dark, and compared expression levels under controlled temperature conditions. Full-length gaCaLP cDNA comprised 1290 nucleotides and contained 498 bp open reading frame that encoded a protein with 165 amino acids. With CaCl2, expression levels of gaCaLP only increased in the presence of light, suggesting that light may be a restrictive factor in CaLP expression when sufficient calcium is available in the environment. In addition, after verapami treatment, we noted that a down regulation of gaCaLP, suggesting that the expression of CaLP is closely related to extracellular Ca2+ influx. Under temperature stress at both high (30 degrees C) and low (20 degrees C) temperatures, expression levels of gaCaLP showed an initial increase, followed by a decreasing trend as treatment progressed. Expression levels reached their maximum value at 24h. This result showed that CaLP participated in a temperature stress response, and Ca2+ homeostasis was disrupted during stress.

Bleaching events can span large geographic areas and are currently a salient threat to coral reefs worldwide. Much effort has been focused on understanding the molecular and cellular events underlying bleaching, and these studies have mainly utilized heat and light stress regimes. In an effort to determine whether different stressors share common bleaching mechanisms, we used complementary DNA (cDNA) microarrays for the corals Acropora palmata and Montastraea faveolata (containing >10,000 features) to measure differential gene expression during darkness stress. Our results reveal a striking transcriptomic response to darkness in A. palmata involving chaperone and antioxidant up-regulation, growth arrest, and metabolic modifications. As these responses were previously measured during thermal stress, our results suggest that different stressors may share common bleaching mechanisms. Furthermore, our results point to hypoxia and endoplasmic reticulum stress as critical cellular events involved in molecular bleaching mechanisms. On the other hand, we identified a meager transcriptomic response to darkness in M. faveolata where gene expression differences between host colonies and sampling locations were greater than differences between control and stressed fragments. This and previous coral microarray studies reveal the immense range of transcriptomic responses that are possible when studying two coral species that differ greatly in their ecophysiology, thus pointing to the importance of comparative approaches in forecasting how corals will respond to future environmental change.","0722-4028","1432-0975",NA,"MAR",2012,31,"1",215,"228","","10.1007/s00338-011-0833-4",NA,"","WOS:000303449900023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

Many scleractinian corals exhibit diel cycles of polyp expansion and contraction entrained by diel sunlight patterns, and monthly cycles of spawning or planulation that correspond to lunar moonlight cycles. The molecular mechanisms for regulating such cycles are poorly understood. In this study, we identified four molecular clock genes (cry1, cry2, clock and cycle) in the scleractinian coral, Favia fragum, and investigated patterns of gene expression hypothesized to be involved in the corals' diel polyp behavior and lunar reproductive cycles. Using quantitative PCR, we measured fluctuations in expression of these clock genes over both diel and monthly spawning timeframes. Additionally, we assayed gene expression and polyp expansion-contraction behavior in experimental corals in normal light: dark (control) or constant dark treatments. Well-defined and reproducible diel patterns in cry1, cry2, and clock expression were observed in both field-collected and the experimental colonies maintained under control light: dark conditions, but no pattern was observed for cycle. Colonies in the control light: dark treatment also displayed diel rhythms of tentacle expansion and contraction. Experimental colonies in the constant dark treatment lost diel patterns in cry1, cry2, and clock expression and displayed a diminished and less synchronous pattern of tentacle expansion and contraction. We observed no pattern in cry1, cry2, clock, or cycle expression correlated with monthly spawning events suggesting these genes are not involved in the entrainment of reproductive cycles to lunar light cycles in F. fragum.

Differential expression and protein analyses revealed a strong, diverse immune response to EBD characterized by phagocytosis, adhesion andmelanization on the part of the host. Furthermore, coexpression network analyses suggested this might come at the cost of reduced cell cycle progression and growth. This is in accordance with past histological studies of naturally infected hard corals, suggesting that potential trade-offs during infection may affect post-outbreak recovery of reef ecosystems by reducing both organismal growth and fecundity.

Coral fragments challenged with V. coralliilyticus appeared healthy while fragments challenged with Alteromonas sp. showed signs of tissue lesions after 48 hr. Coral-associated bacterial community profiles assessed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis changed after challenge by both bacterial strains with the Alteromonas sp. treatment demonstrating the greatest community shift. Transcriptional profiles of c3 and hsp70 increased at 24 hours and correlated with disease signs in the Alteromonas sp. treatment. The expression of hsp70 also showed a significant increase in V. coralliilyticus inoculated corals at 24 h suggesting that even in the absence of disease signs, the microbial inoculum activated a stress response in the coral. C-type lectin did not show a response to any of the bacterial treatments.

Rising sea surface temperature promotes the infection of corals by this bacterium, which causes several coral pathologies, such as bacterial bleaching, tissue lysis, and white syndrome.

In the ocean, fundamental changes are occurring due to anthropogenic pressures, including increased disease outbreaks on coral reefs. These outbreaks include multiple parasites, calling into question how host immunity functions in this complex milieu. Our work investigates the interplay of factors influencing co-infection in the Caribbean sea fan octocoral, Gorgonia ventalina, using metrics of the innate immune response: cellular immunity and expression of candidate immune genes. We used existing copepod infections and live pathogen inoculation with the Aspergillus sydowii fungus, detecting increased expression of the immune recognition gene Tachylectin 5A (T5A) in response to both parasites. Cellular immunity increased by 8.16% in copepod infections compared to controls and single Aspergillus infections. We also detected activation of cellular immunity in reef populations, with a 13.6% increase during copepod infections. Cellular immunity was similar in the field and in the lab, increasing with copepod infections and not the fungus. Amoebocyte density and the expression of T5A and a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gene were also positively correlated across all treatments and colonies, irrespective of parasitic infection. We then assessed the scaling of immune metrics to population-level disease patterns and found random co-occurrence of copepods and fungus across 15 reefs in Puerto Rico. The results suggest immune activation by parasites may not alter parasite co-occurrence if factors other than immunity prevail in structuring parasite infection. We assessed non-immune factors in the field and found that sea fan colony size predicted infection by the copepod parasite. Moreover, the effect of infection on immunity was small relative to that of site differences and live coral cover, and similar to the effect of reproductive status. While additional immune data would shed light on the extent of this pattern, ecological factors may play a larger role than immunity in controlling parasite patterns in the wild. Parsing the effects of immunity and ecological factors in octocoral co-infection shows how disease depends on more than one host and one parasite and explores the application of co-infection research to a colonial marine organism.","1664-3224","",NA,"11-Jan",2021,11,"",NA,"","608066","10.3389/fimmu.2020.608066",NA,"","WOS:000610831500001",33505396,NA,NA,NA,NA,"pathogen",1,"none",1

Many symbiotic organisms have evolved similar mechanisms to face these challenges, including manipulation of the host's transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) pathway. Here we investigate the TGF beta pathway in scelaractinian corals which are dependent on symbioses with dinoflagellates from the family Symbiodiniaceae. Using the Caribbean coral, Orbicella faveolata, we explore the effects of enhancement and inhibition of the TGF beta pathway on host gene expression. Following transcriptomic analyses, we demonstrated limited effects of pathway manipulation in absence of immune stimulation. However, manipulation of the TGF beta pathway significantly affects the subsequent ability of host corals to mount an immune response. Enhancement of the TGF beta pathway eliminates transcriptomic signatures of host coral immune response, while inhibition of the pathway maintains the response. This is, to our knowledge, the first evidence of an immunomodulatory role for TGF beta in a scelaractinian coral. These findings suggest variation in TGF beta signaling may have implications in the face of increasing disease prevelance. Our results suggest that the TGF beta pathway can modulate tradeoffs between symbiosis and immunity.

Although coral immunity has been the subject of increasing study, the available information remains fragmentary, especially with respect to coral antimicrobial responses. In this study, we characterized damicornin from Pocillopora damicornis, the first scleractinian antimicrobial peptide (AMP) to be reported. We found that its precursor has a segmented organization comprising a signal peptide, an acidic proregion, and the C-terminal AMP. The 40-residue AMP is cationic, C-terminally amidated, and characterized by the presence of six cysteine molecules joined by three intramolecular disulfide bridges. Its cysteine array is common to another AMP and toxins from cnidarians; this suggests a common ancestor, as has been proposed for AMPs and toxins from arthropods. Damicornin was active in vitro against Gram-positive bacteria and the fungus Fusarium oxysporum. Damicornin expression was studied using a combination of immunohistochemistry, reverse phase HPLC, and quantitative RT-PCR. Our data show that damicornin is constitutively transcribed in ectodermal granular cells, where it is stored, and further released in response to nonpathogenic immune challenge.

Here we compared transcriptome-wide gene expression between resistant and susceptible staghorn corals exposed to WBD using in situ transmission assays. We identified constitutive gene expression differences underlying disease resistance that are independent from the immune response associated with disease exposure. Genes involved in RNA interference-mediated gene silencing, including Argonaute were up-regulated in resistant corals, whereas heat shock proteins (HSPs) were down-regulated. Up-regulation of Argonaute proteins indicates that post-transcriptional gene silencing plays a key, but previously unsuspected role in coral immunity and disease resistance. Constitutive expression of HSPs has been linked to thermal resilience in other Acropora corals, suggesting that the down-regulation of HSPs in disease resistant staghorn corals may confer a dual benefit of thermal resilience.","1932-6203","",NA,"19-Jan",2016,11,"1",NA,"","e0146636","10.1371/journal.pone.0146636",NA,"","WOS:000368528400055",26784329,NA,NA,NA,NA,"pathogen",1,"none",1

Constitutive immunity and subsequent immune and transcriptomic responses to the challenge were more prominent in high-mortality individuals, whereas low-mortality corals remained largely unaffected and maintained expression signatures of a healthier condition (i.e., did not launch a large stress response). Our results suggest that lesions appeared due to changes in the coral pathobiome (multiple bacterial species associated with disease) and general health deterioration after the biotic disturbance, rather than the direct activity of any specific pathogen. If diseases in nature arise because of weaknesses in holobiont physiology, instead of the virulence of any single etiological agent, environmental stressors compromising coral condition might play a larger role in disease outbreaks than is currently thought.

Additionally, the expression of P-gp was examined following exposure to 0.5 and 5 mu M concentrations of the chemotherapeutic drug vinblastine, a classic Substrate of P-gp. The expression of P-gp increased significantly in corals treated with vinblastine and also increased following exposure to copper and Corexit (TM) 9527. Hsp70, and to a lesser extent Hsp90 expression increased following exposure to copper and Corexit (TM) 9527 indicating a general cellular stress response. Densities of symbiotic algae in the tissues of the corals did not change significantly during the experiments, nor was any loss or paling of coral tissues observed. These findings provide important insight into how corals defend themselves against pollution and complement ongoing initiatives developing molecular biomarkers of stress in reef-building corals.

However, the mechanisms by which oil and dispersed oil impact deep marine fauna are not well understood. Here, we investigate the effects of oil and dispersed oil on a black coral common in the deep Gulf of Mexico, Leiopathes glaberrima. This coral occurs in several color morphs that show ecological and genetic differences. We hypothesized that dispersed oil would be more detrimental to coral health than oil alone and that this difference would be detectable in the gene expression response of the colonies even at sub-lethal concentrations. In two experiments, four and six colonies of red and white color morphs were exposed to oil, dispersant, and dispersed oil for a minimum of 96 hours. Visual assessment indicated that indeed dispersant and dispersed oil treatments were more damaging than oil alone, for target concentrations of 25 mg L-1. Decline in health was observed for all treatments, independently of color morphotype, but the decline was faster in the white colonies exposed to dispersant. The responses to the treatments were also investigated by monitoring gene expression after 24 hours of sub-lethal chemical exposure. Coral gene expression differed by chemical stressor. Interestingly, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon biomarker gene, cytochrome P450, was only up-regulated in dispersed oil but not oil alone, suggesting that the dispersant increased the availability of such hydrocarbons in the tissue. The gene expression response was apparent at 24 hours when visual impacts were not (yet) detectable. The use of chemical dispersants in oil-spill remediation may cause health declines in deep-water corals and deserves further study.","2325-1026","",NA,"14-Dec",2017,5,"",NA,"","77","10.1525/elementa.261",NA,"","WOS:000417894900001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"pollutants",1,"none",1

Despite catastrophic incidents like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DWHOS) disaster that occurred in 2010, offshore oil and gas drilling continues to occur around the world. Previous work investigating the toxicity of oil and the chemical dispersant used in an attempt to mitigate the effects of the DWHOS revealed that the dispersant elicits a stronger, negative physiological response than oil alone. However, little is known regarding the specific ways in which these anthropogenic pollutants impact organisms at the cellular level. To investigate the impacts of each pollutant and their synergistic effects on corals, we analyzed the transcriptional responses of the deep-sea octocorals Callogorgia delta and Paramuricea type B3 following 12 h of exposure to oil, dispersant, and mixtures of oil and dispersant. Analyses revealed that the highest levels of significant differential gene expression were found among the treatments containing dispersant, which corresponds to the significant effects observed in physiological experiments. Functional analyses of annotated transcripts further suggest both species- and colonyspecific responses to the exposures, likely due to underlying cellular and physiological differences. However, some commonalities were observed among the responses to chemical stress across treatments and species, including immune and cellular stress responses, altered energy metabolism, and oxidative stress, elucidating how corals respond to chemical pollutants. As resource extraction is an ongoing threat, this study demonstrates the importance of considering the varied and diverse responses of biota to anthropogenic disturbances and the implications of introducing chemicals into vulnerable ecosystems like those associated with deep-sea corals.","","2296-7745",NA,"8-Apr",2021,8,"",NA,"","","10.3389/fmars.2021.649909",NA,"","WOS:000640396900001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"pollutants",1,"none",1

Caribbean mountainous star coral (Montastraea faveolata) has frequently been used as a model species to study gene expression during stress and bleaching events. Specimens of M. faveolata were collected in Panama and exposed for 17 d to nano-TiO2 suspensions (0.1mgL(-1) and 10mgL(-1)). Exposure to nano-TiO2 caused significant zooxanthellae expulsion in all the colonies, without mortality. Induction of the gene for heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) was observed during an early stage of exposure (day 2), indicating acute stress. However, there was no statistical difference in HSP70 expression on day 7 or 17, indicating possible coral acclimation and recovery from stress. No other genes were significantly upregulated. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis revealed that nano-TiO2 was predominantly trapped and stored within the posterior layer of the coral fragment (burrowing sponges, bacterial and fungal mats). The bioconcentration factor in the posterior layer was close to 600 after exposure to 10mgL(-1) of nano-TiO2 for 17 d. The transient increase in HSP70, expulsion of zooxanthellae, and bioaccumulation of nano-TiO2 in the microflora of the coral colony indicate the potential of such exposure to induce stress and possibly contribute to an overall decrease in coral populations.

These two coral species were exposed to 10 and 40 mu g.L-1 BaP for 24 hand 72 h, respectively. The results show that (1) BaP affects the health of the zooxanthellae in coral symbiosis after BaP exposure for 72 h due to a significant decline in chlorophyll a concentrations in Acropora spp. during this period.

We conducted genetic analyses ofPocillopora acutaduring initiation of hyperosmosis-induced polyp bail-out, using both transcriptomic and qPCR techniques. Beyond upregulation of apoptosis and proteolysis, corals showed significant activation of tumor necrosis factor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathways during induction of polyp bail-out. In our qPCR analysis, a common upregulation profile, peaking at 43.0 parts per thousand salinity, was found in the FAS and CASP8 genes, whereas a different profile, showing significant upregulation up to 45.0 parts per thousand, was displayed by matrix metalloproteinases and genes in the FGF signaling pathway. These results suggest parallel involvement of an extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway and FGF-mediated extracellular matrix degradation in polyp bail-out. Furthermore, in the XIAP, JNK, and NFKB1 genes, we detected a third expression profile showing linear upregulation that becomes maximal at the endpoint salinity level of the experiment (46.0 parts per thousand), indicating activation of anti-apoptotic and cell survival signals during polyp bail-out.

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction data further demonstrated that genetic recovery of energy production, cell proliferation, and immune response was achieved in morphologically recovered polyps within 3 days after bail-out, but was not fully accomplished in degenerated polyps even after 5 days.

Until recently, DMSP was believed to be synthesized exclusively by photosynthetic organisms; however we now know that corals and specific bacteria can also produce this compound. Corals are major sources of DMSP, but the molecular basis for its biosynthesis is unknown in these organisms. Results: Here we used salinity stress, which is known to trigger DMSP production in other organisms, in conjunction with transcriptomics to identify coral genes likely to be involved in DMSP biosynthesis. We focused specifically on both adults and juveniles of the coral Acropora millepora: after 24 h of exposure to hyposaline conditions, DMSP concentrations increased significantly by 2.6 fold in adult corals and 1.2 fold in juveniles. Concomitantly, candidate genes enabling each of the necessary steps leading to DMSP production were up-regulated. Conclusions: The data presented strongly suggest that corals use an algal-like pathway to generate DMSP from methionine, and are able to rapidly change expression of the corresponding genes in response to environmental stress. However, our data also indicate that DMSP is unlikely to function primarily as an osmolyte in corals, instead potentially serving as a scavenger of ROS and as a molecular sink for excess methionine produced as a consequence of proteolysis and osmolyte catabolism in corals under hypo-osmotic conditions.","1471-2164","",NA,"14-Aug",2017,18,"",NA,"","612","10.1186/s12864-017-3959-0",NA,"","WOS:000408036300004",28806970,NA,NA,NA,NA,"salinity",1,"none",1

The bacterial metabolite tetrabromopyrrole (TBP), isolated from an extract of Pseudoalteromonas sp. associated with the crustose coralline alga (CCA) Neogoniolithon fosliei, induced coral larval metamorphosis (100%) with little or no attachment (0-2%). To better understand the molecular events and mechanisms underpinning the induction of Acropora millepora larval metamorphosis, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, migration, adhesion and biomineralisation, two novel coral gene expression assays were implemented. These involved the use of reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and employed 47 genes of interest (GOI), selected based on putative roles in the processes of settlement and metamorphosis. Substantial differences in transcriptomic responses of GOI were detected following incubation of A. millepora larvae with a threshold concentration and 10-fold elevated concentration of TBP-containing extracts of Pseudoalteromonas sp. The notable and relatively abrupt changes of the larval body structure during metamorphosis correlated, at the molecular level, with significant differences (p < 0.05) in gene expression profiles of 24 GOI, 12 hours post exposure. Fourteen of those GOI also presented differences in expression (p < 0.05) following exposure to the threshold concentration of bacterial TBP-containing extract. The specificity of the bacterial TBP-containing extract to induce the metamorphic stage in A. millepora larvae without attachment, using a robust, low cost, accurate, ecologically relevant and highly reproducible RT-qPCR assay, allowed partially decoupling of the transcriptomic processes of attachment and metamorphosis. The bacterial TBP-containing extract provided a unique opportunity to monitor the regulation of genes exclusively involved in the process of metamorphosis, contrasting previous gene expression studies that utilized cues, such as crustose coralline algae, biofilms or with GLW-amide neuropeptides that stimulate the entire onset of larval metamorphosis and attachment.","1932-6203","",NA,"24-May",2012,7,"5",NA,"","e37774","10.1371/journal.pone.0037774",NA,"","WOS:000305338900043",22655067,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

Although extensive ecological data has been acquired, underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, to better understand mechanisms underlying gametogenesis, we isolated ovaries and testes at different developmental phases from a gonochoric coral,Euphyllia ancora, and adopted a transcriptomic approach to reveal sex- and phase-specific gene expression profiles. In particular, we explored genes associated with oocyte development and maturation, spermiogenesis, sperm motility / capacitation, and fertilization. Results 1.6 billion raw reads were obtained from 24 gonadal samples. De novo assembly of trimmed reads, and elimination of contigs derived from symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodiniaceae) and other organisms yielded a referenceE. ancoragonadal transcriptome of 35,802 contigs. Analysis of 4 developmental phases identified 2023 genes that were differentially expressed during oogenesis and 678 during spermatogenesis. In premature/mature ovaries, 631 genes were specifically upregulated, with 538 in mature testes. Upregulated genes included those involved in gametogenesis, gamete maturation, sperm motility / capacitation, and fertilization in other metazoans, including humans. Meanwhile, a large number of genes without homology to sequences in the SWISS-PROT database were also observed among upregulated genes in premature / mature ovaries and mature testes. Conclusions Our findings show that scleractinian gametogenesis shares many molecular characteristics with that of other metazoans, but it also possesses unique characteristics developed during cnidarian and/or scleractinian evolution. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to create a gonadal transcriptome assembly from any scleractinian. This study and associated datasets provide a foundation for future studies regarding gametogenesis and differences between male and female colonies from molecular and cellular perspectives. Furthermore, our transcriptome assembly will be a useful reference for future development of sex-specific and/or stage-specific germ cell markers that can be used in coral aquaculture and ecological studies.","1471-2164","",NA,"21-Oct",2020,21,"1",NA,"","732","10.1186/s12864-020-07113-9",NA,"","WOS:000580562500001",33087060,NA,NA,NA,NA,"pollutants;UVR;pollutants x UVR",3,"interaction",2

Reef-building corals are increasingly exposed to local and global stressors that alter nutritional status causing reduced fitness and mortality, however, these responses can vary considerably across species and populations. Methodology/Principal Findings: We compare the expression of 22 coral host genes in individuals from an inshore and an offshore reef location using quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) over the course of 26 days following translocation into a shaded, filtered seawater environment. Declines in lipid content and PSII activity of the algal endosymbionts (Symbiodinium ITS-1 type C2) over the course of the experiment indicated that heterotrophic uptake and photosynthesis were limited, creating nutritional deprivation conditions. Regulation of coral host genes involved in metabolism, CO2 transport and oxidative stress could be detected already after five days, whereas PSII activity took twice as long to respond. Opposing expression trajectories of Tgl, which releases fatty acids from the triacylglycerol storage, and Dgat1, which catalyses the formation of triglycerides, indicate that the decline in lipid content can be attributed, at least in part, by mobilisation of triacylglycerol stores. Corals from the inshore location had initially higher lipid content and showed consistently elevated expression levels of two genes involved in metabolism (aldehyde dehydrogenase) and calcification (carbonic anhydrase). Conclusions/Significance: Coral host gene expression adjusts rapidly upon change in nutritional conditions, and therefore can serve as an early signature of imminent coral stress. Consistent gene expression differences between populations indicate that corals acclimatize and/or adapt to local environments. Our results set the stage for analysis of these processes in natural coral populations, to better understand the responses of coral communities to global climate change and to develop more efficient management strategies.","1932-6203","",NA,"9-May",2013,8,"5",NA,"","e61736","10.1371/journal.pone.0061736",NA,"","WOS:000319737700004",23671571,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

These outliers differed from the statistically normally behaving colonies in having not only higher RNA/DNA ratios but also elevated expression levels of three genes: 1) Symbiodinium zinc-induced facilitator-like 1-like, 2) host coral copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, and 3) host green fluorescent protein-like chromoprotein.

Mass coral bleaching and mortality have recently occurred where reefs have experienced chronic low oxygen events. However, the mechanistic basis of tolerance to oxygen levels inadequate to sustain normal functioning (i.e. hypoxia) and whether it contributes to bleaching susceptibility, remain unknown. We therefore experimentally exposed colonies of the environmentally resilient Acropora tenuis, a common reef-building coral from the Great Barrier Reef, to deoxygenation-reoxygenation stress that was aligned to their natural night-day light cycle. Specifically, the treatment involved removing the 'night-time O-2 buffer' to challenge the inherent hypoxia thresholds. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that coral possess a complete and active hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated hypoxia response system (HRS) homologous to other metazoans. As expected, A. tenuis exhibited bleaching resistance and showed a strong inducibility of HIF target genes in response to deoxygenation stress. We applied this same approach in parallel to a colony of Acropora selago, known to be environmnetally susceptible, which conversely exhibited a bleaching phenotype response. This phenotypic divergence of A. selago was accompanied by contrasting gene expression profiles indicative of varied effectiveness of their HIF-HRS. Based on our RNA-Seq analysis, we propose (a) that the HIF-HRS is central for corals to manage deoxygenation stress and (b) that key genes of this system (and the wider gene network) may contribute to variation in coral bleaching susceptibility. Our analysis suggests that heat shock protein (hsp) 70 and 90 are important for low oxygen stress tolerance and further highlights how hsp90 expression might also affect the inducibility of coral HIF-HRS in overcoming a metabolic crisis under deoxygenation stress. We propose that differences in coral HIF-HRS could be central in regulating sensitivity to other climate change stressors-notably thermal stress-that commonly drive bleaching.","1354-1013","1365-2486",NA,"JAN",2021,27,"2",312,"326","","10.1111/gcb.15436",NA,"Nov-20","WOS:000589553100001",33197302,NA,NA,NA,NA,"oxygen level",1,"none",1

Understanding variation in rates of bleaching recovery among species and how that translates to resilience to recurrent bleaching is fundamental to predicting the impacts of increasing disturbances on coral reefs globally. We tracked the response of two heat sensitive species in the genus Acropora to repeated bleaching events during the austral summers of 2015 and 2017. Despite a similar bleaching response, the species Acropora gemmifera recovered faster based on transcriptome-wide gene expression patterns and had a more dynamic algal symbiont community than Acropora hyacinthus growing on the same reef. Moreover, A. gemmifera had higher survival to repeated heat extremes, with six-fold lower mortality than A. hyacinthus. These patterns suggest that speed of recovery from a first round of bleaching, based on multiple mechanisms, contributes strongly to sensitivity to a second round of bleaching.

An outstanding question in marine biology is why some scleractinian corals do not provision their eggs and larvae with the endosymbiotic dinoflagellates that are necessary for a juvenile's ultimate survival. We tested whether the acquisition of photosynthetic endosymbionts (family Symbiodiniaceae) during the planktonic larval stage was advantageous, as is widely assumed, in the ecologically important and threatened Caribbean reef-building coral Orbicella faveolata. Following larval acquisition, similar changes occurred in host energetic lipid use and gene expression regardless of whether their symbionts were photosynthesizing, suggesting the symbionts did not provide the energetic benefit characteristic of the mutualism in adults. Larvae that acquired photosymbionts isolated from conspecific adults on their natal reef exhibited a reduction in swimming, which may interfere with their ability to find suitable settlement substrate, and also a decrease in survival. Larvae exposed to two cultured algal species did not exhibit differences in survival, but decreased their swimming activity in response to one species. We conclude that acquiring photosymbionts during the larval stage confers no advantages and can in fact be disadvantageous to this coral host. The timing of symbiont acquisition appears to be a critical component of a host's life history strategy and overall reproductive fitness, and this timing itself appears to be under selective pressure.","0962-1083","1365-294X",NA,"JAN",2019,28,"1",141,"155","","10.1111/mec.14967",NA,"","WOS:000456604600011",30506836,NA,NA,NA,NA,"infection status",1,"none",1

In addition, a meta-analysis of global gene expression studies in other corals and anemones was used to contrast differential regulation as a result of disease and thermal stress from patterns correlated with symbiotic state. Symbiont density, chlorophyllacontent, holobiont productivity, instant calcification rate, and total host protein content were uniformly reduced in WPS relative to healthy tissue. While expression patterns associated with WPS were secondary to fixed effects of source colony, specific functional enrichments combined with a lack of immune regulation suggest that the viral infection putatively giving rise to this condition affects symbiont rather than host cells. Expression in response to WPS also clustered independently of patterns in white syndrome impactedA. hyacinthus, further supporting a distinct aetiology of this syndrome. Expression patterns in WPS-affected tissues were significantly correlated with prior studies that examined short-term thermal stress responses independent of symbiotic state, suggesting that the majority of expression changes reflect a nonspecific stress response.

In the present study, transcriptome profiling was conducted on the tropical corallimorpharian, Ricordea yuma, following the establishment of symbiosis with either the 'homologous' symbiont Symbiodinium goreaui (also known as Cladocopium goreaui; ITS2 type C1) or 'heterologous' symbionts (predominantly S. trenchii, which is also known as Durusdinium trenchii; ITS2 type D1a) isolated from a different corallimorpharian host (Rhodactis indosinensis). Transcriptomic analyses showed that genes encoding host glycogen biosynthesis pathway components are more highly induced during colonization by the homologous symbiont than by the heterologous symbiont. Similar patterns were also observed for several other genes thought to facilitate symbiotic nutrient exchange, including those involved in lipid translocation/storage and metabolite transport. The gene expression results presented here imply that colonization by homologous or heterologous Symbiodinium types may have very different metabolic consequences for the Ricordea host, supporting the notion that even though some cnidarians may be able to form novel symbioses after bleaching, the metabolic performance of these may be compromised.

Indeed, microarray-based analyses point to the conclusion that host gene expression is largely or completely unresponsive during the establishment of symbiosis with a competent strain of Symbiodinium. In this study, the use of Illumina RNA-Seq technology allowed detection of a transient period of differential expression involving a small number of genes (1073 transcripts; <3% of the transcriptome) 4 h after the exposure of Acropora digitifera planulae to a competent strain of Symbiodinium (a clade B strain). This phenomenon has not previously been detected as a consequence of both the lower sensitivity of the microarray approaches used and the sampling times used. The results indicate that complex changes occur, including transient suppression of mitochondrial metabolism and protein synthesis, but are also consistent with the hypothesis that the symbiosome is a phagosome that has undergone early arrest, raising the possibility of common mechanisms in the symbiotic interactions of corals and symbiotic sea anemones with their endosymbionts.","0962-1083","1365-294X",NA,"JUL",2016,25,"13",3127,"3141","","10.1111/mec.13659",NA,"","WOS:000378942200013",27094992,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

One major cause of this decline is increasing sea surface temperature. However, conspecific colonies separated by even small spatial distances appear to show varying responses to this global stressor. One factor contributing to differential responses to heat stress is variability in the coral's micro-environment, such as the amount of water flow a coral experiences. High flow provides corals with a variety of health benefits, including heat stress mitigation. Here, we investigate how water flow affects coral gene expression and provides resilience to increasing temperatures. We examined host and photosymbiont gene expression of Acropora cf. pulchra colonies in discrete in situ flow environments during a natural bleaching event. In addition, we conducted controlled ex situ tank experiments where we exposed A. cf. pulchra to different flow regimes and acute heat stress. Notably, we observed distinct flow-driven transcriptomic signatures related to energy expenditure, growth, heterotrophy and a healthy coral host-photosymbiont relationship. We also observed disparate transcriptomic responses during bleaching recovery between the high- and low-flow sites. Additionally, corals exposed to high flow showed ""frontloading"" of specific heat-stress-related genes such as heat shock proteins, antioxidant enzymes, genes involved in apoptosis regulation, innate immunity and cell adhesion. We posit that frontloading is a result of increased oxidative metabolism generated by the increased water movement. Gene frontloading may at least partially explain the observation that colonies in high-flow environments show higher survival and/or faster recovery in response to bleaching events.","0962-1083","1365-294X",NA,"MAY",2021,30,"9",2009,"2024","","10.1111/mec.15869",NA,"Mar-21","WOS:000631551000001",33655552,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature;acidification;temp x OA",3,"interaction",2

In this study, we tested two relevant environmental factors that can have deleterious effects on corals: heat and sediment. We examined among-genotype responses of Pocillopora acuta to these factors with RNA-Seq in concert with widely-used tools for assessing the physiological conditions of corals. Heat and sediment treatments were applied in a 2 x 2 crossed experimental design: (1) similar to 30 degrees C without sediment (control, ""C""), (2) similar to 30 degrees C with sediment (sediment-only, ""S""), (3) similar to 32 degrees C without sediment (heat-only, ""H""), (4) similar to 32 degrees C with sediment (heat + sediment, ""H+S"") over four consecutive days (3-h daily exposure) in ex situ aquarium conditions. A clear differentiation in gene expression patterns was observed in corals exposed to heat alone and to heat with sediment, relative to the control treatment. Few transcripts (similar to 3) were found to be differentially expressed for corals exposed to sediment only. The greater impact of heat was supported by photo-physiological measurements that showed significant effects on maximum quantum yield and average symbiont density among genotypes of P acute. The combined effect of heat and sediment caused a greater reduction in average symbiont density than the effect of sediment alone. Furthermore, ""H+S"" disrupted the ability of corals to maintain processes involving assembly and disassembly of cilium which suggests a synergistic effect between the two factors. We also found that host-specific genes which were expressed differentially may not be related to their interactions with algal symbionts. Rather, these genes are involved in a variety of biological functions including, but not limited to, cilium biogenesis and degradation, cilia motility, innate and adaptive immune responses, cell adhesion and bone mineralization, and processes involved in the cell cycle. These results reflect the complex response of the host alone. Overall, our findings indicate that acute heat stress in tandem with sediment can depress photo-physiological performance and trigger considerable changes in host gene expression.","","2296-7745",NA,"19-Mar",2019,6,"",NA,"","121","10.3389/fmars.2019.00121",NA,"","WOS:000462730100001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature;sediment;temp x sediment",3,"interaction",2

Gene expression analysis based on quantitative PCR (qPCR) can be used as a diagnostic tool to determine coral condition in situ. We evaluated the expression of 13 candidate genes during heat-light stress in a common Caribbean coral Porites astreoides, and observed strong and consistent changes in gene expression in two independent experiments. Furthermore, we found that the apparent return to baseline expression levels during a recovery phase was rapid, despite visible signs of colony bleaching. We show that the response to acute heat-light stress in P. astreoides can be monitored by measuring the difference in expression of only two genes: Hsp16 and actin. We demonstrate that this assay discriminates between corals sampled from two field sites experiencing different temperatures.

In this study, we focused on the potential for adaptation in Orbicella faveolata, a dominant reef-builder in the Caribbean. We conducted thermal stress experiments using corals collected from natural populations in Bocas del Toro, Panama, and used multilocus SNP genotypes to estimate genetic relatedness among samples. This allowed us to estimate narrow-sense heritability of variation in bleaching responses, revealing that variation in these responses was highly heritable (h(2) = 0.58). This suggests substantial potential for adaptive responses to warming by natural populations of O. faveolata in this region. We further investigated the functional basis for this variation using genomic and transcriptomic approaches. We used a publicly available genetic linkage map and genome assembly to map markers associated with bleaching responses, identifying twelve markers associated with variation in bleaching responses. We also profiled gene expression in corals with contrasting bleaching phenotypes, uncovering substantial differences in transcriptional stress responses between heat-tolerant and heat-susceptible corals. Together, our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence that natural populations of corals possess genetic variation in thermal stress responses that may potentially support adaptive responses to rising ocean temperatures.","0962-1083","1365-294X",NA,"MAY",2019,28,"9",2238,"2253","","10.1111/mec.15081",NA,"","WOS:000471073000009",30913323,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1

We investigated the bleaching and transcriptome response of 20 Acropora hyacinthus colonies 5 and 20h after exposure to control (29 degrees C) or heated (35 degrees C) conditions. We found a highly dynamic transcriptome response: 27% of the coral transcriptome was significantly regulated 1h postheat exposure. Yet 15h later, when heat-induced coral bleaching became apparent, only 12% of the transcriptome was differentially regulated. A large proportion of responsive genes at the first time point returned to control levels, others remained differentially expressed over time, while an entirely different subset of genes was successively regulated at the second time point. However, a noteworthy variability in gene expression was observed among individual coral colonies. Among the genes of which expression lingered over time, fast return to normal levels was associated with low bleaching. Colonies that maintained higher expression levels of these genes bleached severely. Return to normal levels of gene expression after stress has been termed transcriptome resilience, and in the case of some specific genes may signal the physiological health and response ability of individuals to environmental stress.","0962-1083","1365-294X",NA,"APR",2015,24,"7",1467,"1484","","10.1111/mec.13125",NA,"","WOS:000351631500006",25728233,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1

Among the six ICGs tested, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and the ribosomal protein genes S7 and L9 exhibited the most constant expression levels between samples from healthy-looking colonies and samples from the same colonies when severely bleached a year later. These ICGs were therefore utilised for normalisation of expression data for seven selected GOIs.

Furthermore, the ETS-family module shows repeated differences in expression among coral colonies grown in the same common garden environment, suggesting a heritable genetic or epigenetic basis for these expression polymorphisms.

Upon exposure to thermal stress, the intracellular formation of harmful oxygen intermediates can lead to the disruption of the obligate symbiosis between the coral host and their dinoflagellate endosymbionts (zooxanthellae), a process known as coral bleaching. Applications of molecular techniques to cnidarian research have recently enhanced our understanding of the magnitude of corals' transcriptional response to various stressors. In the present study, we developed a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay to assess expression levels of 4 genes involved in the corals' oxidative stress response (HSP70, MnSOD, ferritin, Zn2+-metalloprotease) after exposure to laboratory-controlled thermal stress. Using the Indo-Pacific reef coral Acropora millepora, our study provides the first population-scale analysis of antioxidant gene expression in coral. Despite the significant up-regulation of those 4 genes in the thermally stressed samples relative to non-stressed samples, our results show that there is an enormous intraas well as inter-colony variation in transcript abundance at a particular point in time. We discuss the potential roles of ferritin and Zn2+-metalloprotease in the break down of the intra-cellular Fe2+-homeostasis and in coral host cell detachment, respectively, during bleaching conditions.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to evaluate the gene expression. Overall, both acute and chronic heat stress treatments elicited a response in gene expression relative to control samples. Acute heat exposure resulted in up-regulation of catalase, BCL-2, and HSP90 at all time points from hour 24 to 48, suggesting the activation of an oxidative protective enzyme, molecular chaperone, and anti-apoptotic protein. Fewer genes were up-regulated in the chronic experiment until hour 288 (30 degrees C) where catalase, RpL9, and RpS7 were significantly up-regulated. Chronic heat exposure elicited a physiological response at 30 degrees C, which we propose as a heat-stress threshold for Montastraea cavernosa (M. cavernosa) collected from an MCE.","","2073-4441",NA,"MAY",2020,12,"5",NA,"","1303","10.3390/w12051303",NA,"","WOS:000555915200082",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1

Here, we compare transcriptome-wide gene expression (via RNA-Seq using Illumina sequencing) among conspecific thermally sensitive and thermally resilient corals to identify the molecular pathways contributing to coral resilience. Under simulated bleaching stress, sensitive and resilient corals change expression of hundreds of genes, but the resilient corals had higher expression under control conditions across 60 of these genes.

For long-lived organisms, acclimation likely generates a faster response but is only effective if the rates and limits of acclimation match the dynamics of local environmental variation. In coral reef habitats, heat stress from extreme ocean warming can occur over several weeks, resulting in symbiont expulsion and widespread coral death. However, transcriptome regulation during short-term acclimation is not well understood. We examined acclimation during a 11-day experiment in the coral Acropora nana. We acclimated colonies to three regimes: ambient temperature (29 degrees C), increased stable temperature (31 degrees C), and variable temperature (29-33 degrees C), mimicking local heat stress conditions. Within 7-11 days, individuals acclimated to increased temperatures had higher tolerance to acute heat stress. Despite physiological changes, no gene expression changes occurred during acclimation before acute heat stress. However, we found strikingly different transcriptional responses to heat stress between acclimation treatments across 893 contigs. Across these contigs, corals acclimated to higher temperatures (31 degrees C or 29-33 degrees C) exhibited a muted stress response-the magnitude of expression change before and after heat stress was less than in 29 degrees C acclimated corals. Our results show that corals have a rapid phase of acclimation that substantially increases their heat resilience within 7 days and that alters their transcriptional response to heat stress. This is in addition to a previously observed longer term response, distinguishable by its shift in baseline expression, under nonstressful conditions. Such rapid acclimation may provide some protection for this species of coral against slow onset of warming ocean temperatures.","1759-6653","",NA,"JUN",2015,7,"6",1602,"1612","","10.1093/gbe/evv085",NA,"","WOS:000358800100015",25979751,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1

The domain analyses of assembled transcripts revealed 30 HSP70 gene contigs in stony coral Pocillopora damicornis. One crucial HSP70 (PdHSP70) was observed, whose expressions were induced by both elevated temperature and ammonium after expression difference analysis. The complete complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence of PdHSP70 was identified, which encoded a polypeptide of 650 amino acids with a molecular weight of 71.93 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of PdHSP70 contained a HSP70 domain (from Pro8 to Gly616), and it shared the highest similarity (95%) with HSP70 from Stylophora pistillata.

These include caspase activity and the expression profiles of the S. pistillata caspase and Bcl-2 genes (StyCasp and StyBcl-2-like) cloned in this study. In corals exposed to thermal stress (32 or 34 degrees C), caspase activity and the expression levels of the StyBcl-2-like gene increased over time (6-48 h) and declined to basal levels within 72 h of thermal stress. Distinct transcript levels were obtained for the StyCasp gene, with stimulated expression from 6 to 48 h of 34 degrees C thermal stress, coinciding with the onset of bleaching. Increased cell death was detected in situ only between 6 to 48 h of stress and was limited to the gastroderm. The bleached corals survived up to one month at 32 degrees C, and recovered back symbionts when placed at 24 degrees C. These results point to a two-stage response in corals that withstand thermal stress: (i) the onset of apoptosis, accompanied by rapid activation of antioxidant/anti-apoptotic mediators that block the progression of apoptosis to other cells and (ii) acclimatization of the coral to the chronic thermal stress alongside the completion of symbiosis breakdown. Accordingly, the coral's ability to rapidly curb apoptosis appears to be the most important trait affecting the coral's thermotolerance and survival.","1932-6203","",NA,"14-Dec",2011,6,"12",NA,"","e28665","10.1371/journal.pone.0028665",NA,"","WOS:000298369100074",22194880,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1

In higher animals and plants, oxylipins synthesized by fatty acid di- and monooxygenases contribute to stress-induced signaling; however, the role of eicosanoid pathways in corals remains unclear.

Yet the potential of the coral-algal symbiosis to genetically adapt in an evolutionary sense to warming oceans is unknown. Using a quantitative genetics approach, we estimated the proportion of the variance in thermal tolerance traits that has a genetic basis (i.e. heritability) as a proxy for their adaptive potential in the widespread Indo-Pacific reef-building coral Acropora millepora. We chose two physiologically different populations that associate respectively with one thermo-tolerant (Symbiodinium clade D) and one less tolerant symbiont type (Symbiodinium C2). In both symbiont types, pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed significant heritabilities for traits related to both photosynthesis and photoprotective pigment profile. However, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays showed a lack of heritability in both coral host populations for their own expression of fundamental stress genes.

High heritabilities for functional key traits of algal symbionts, along with their short clonal generation time and high population sizes allow for their rapid thermal adaptation.

Increasing extreme weather driven by climate change often leads to disruption of this symbiosis and to coral death. Corals can better withstand stress after previous exposure to sublethal conditions, but the mechanisms for this resilience remain unclear. Here, we show that a three-day thermal preconditioning increases tolerance of acute heat stress through modulations in cell death pathways in the stony coral Pocillopora acuta. In preconditioned corals, the ratio of pro-survival (pa-Bcl-2 and pa-BI-1) to pro-death (pa-BAK and pa-BAX) gene expression increased and the corals underwent significantly less bleaching. When treated with Bcl-2 inhibitor, corals lost the improved thermal tolerance, suggesting an important role of programmed cell death in coral bleaching and acclimatization. During heat stress, the activity of acid phosphatase increased but caspase-3 did not, suggesting the involvement of autophagy/symbiophagy rather than apoptosis in this process. A similar shift in gene expression also occurs in thermally stressed corals that have been exposed to naturally higher temperatures during summer thermal maxima in KaneModified Letter Turned Commaohe Bay, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, suggesting that corals can increase their resilience to realistic warming events during high-risk periods through alterations in cell signalling. These data suggest that programmed cell death pathways underly coral acclimatization and resilience and may be important for coral reef conservation and management.","0962-1083","1365-294X",NA,"JUL",2021,30,"14",3560,"3574","","10.1111/mec.15988",NA,"Jun-21","WOS:000658315200001",34008873,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1

Here, we have extended these approaches to study heat tolerance of corals in the Persian/Arabian Gulf, where heat-tolerant local populations experience extreme summer temperatures (up to 36 degrees C). To evaluate whether selection has depleted genetic variation in thermal tolerance, estimate potential future adaptive responses and understand the functional basis for these corals' unusual heat tolerance, we conducted controlled crosses in the Gulf coral Platygyra daedalea. Heat tolerance is highly heritable in this population (h(2) = 0.487-0.748), suggesting substantial potential for adaptive responses to selection for elevated temperatures. To identify genetic markers associated with this variation, we conducted genomewide SNP genotyping in parental corals and tested for relationships between paternal genotype and offspring thermal tolerance. Resulting multilocus SNP genotypes explained a large fraction of variation in thermal tolerance in these crosses (69%). To investigate the functional basis of these differences in thermal tolerance, we profiled transcriptional responses in tolerant and susceptible families, revealing substantial sire effects on transcriptional responses to thermal stress. We also studied sequence variation in these expressed sequences, identifying alleles and functional groups of differentially expressed genes associated with thermal tolerance.

Results: Analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated that increased temperatures may lead to oxidative stress, apoptosis, and a structural reconfiguration of the cytoskeletal network. Metabolic processes were downregulated, and the action of histones and zinc finger-containing proteins may have played a role in the long-term regulation upon heat stress. Conclusions: Embryos responded differently depending on exposure time and temperature level. Embryos showed expression of stress-related genes already at a temperature of 29.0 degrees C, but seemed to be able to counteract the initial response over time. By contrast, embryos at 31.5 degrees C displayed continuous expression of stress genes.

Recovery of coral populations depends in part upon larval recruitment. Many corals reproduce during the warmest time of year when further increases in temperature can lead to low fertilization rates of eggs and high larval mortality. Microarray experiments were designed to capture and assess variability in the thermal stress responses of Acropora palmata larvae from Puerto Rico. Transcription profiles showed a striking acceleration of normal developmental gene expression patterns with increased temperature. The transcriptional response to heat suggested rapid depletion of larval energy stores via peroxisomal lipid oxidation and included key enzymes that indicated the activation of the glyoxylate cycle. High temperature also resulted in expression differences in key developmental signalling genes including the conserved WNT pathway that is critical for pattern formation and tissue differentiation in developing embryos. Expression of these and other important developmental and thermal stress genes such as ferritin, heat shock proteins, cytoskeletal components, cell adhesion and autophagy proteins also varied among larvae derived from different parent colonies. Disruption of normal developmental and metabolic processes will have negative impacts on larval survival and dispersal as temperatures rise. However, it appears that variation in larval response to high temperature remains despite the dramatic population declines.

Following exposure, larvae were tested for survival and settlement, oxidative stress, respiratory demand, and mRNA expression of heat-shock proteins (Hsps) 16 and 60.

Understanding how the same stresses affect the invertebrate host, however, is in its infancy. In this study, we re-examined the direct effect of elevated temperatures on the invertebrate host exploring the early transcriptional response of aposymbiotic (without algal symbionts) coral larvae. The temperatures tested in the experimental design were 24 degrees C (ambient seawater temperature), 28 degrees C and 31 degrees C; and the sampling points were 3 and 10 h after temperature exposure. We explored relative changes in transcription using a cDNA microarray constructed for the scleractinian coral, Acropora millepora, and containing 18 142 expressed sequence tag (EST) clones/8386 unigenes. Our study identified 29 genes that were significantly up- and down-regulated when A. millepora coral larvae were exposed to elevated temperatures. Down-regulation of several key components of DNA/RNA metabolism was detected implying inhibition of general cellular processes. The down-regulation of protein synthesis, however, was not simple and random, which suggested that the stress response was a more complicated adjustment of cellular metabolism. We identified four significant outcomes during the very early hours of the transcriptional response to hyperthermal stress in coral larvae. First, the expression of heat-shock proteins increased rapidly (within 3 h) in response to hyperthermal stress. Second, a fluorescent protein homologue, DsRed-type FP, decreased its expression in response to elevated temperature reinforcing a potential role as a molecular marker for monitoring hyperthermal stress in nature. Third, the down-regulation of a coral mannose-binding C-type lectin under elevated temperature suggests that heat stress might compromise some components of the coral immune defence and therefore might bring about susceptibility to pathogenic diseases. And last, genes involved in protecting cells against oxidative stress showed little response at the early hours to heat stress, supporting the proposal that up-regulation of cnidarian host oxidative stress genes may require reactive oxygen species generated by stressed algal symbionts.","0962-1083","1365-294X",NA,"DEC",2009,18,"24",5101,"5114","","10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04419.x",NA,"","WOS:000272452700012",19900172,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1

In order to identify host transcriptomic changes associated with acquired thermal tolerance in the scleractinian coral Acropora millepora, corals preconditioned to a sub-lethal temperature of 3 degrees C below bleaching threshold temperature were compared to both non-preconditioned corals and untreated controls using a cDNA microarray platform. After eight days of hyperthermal challenge, conditions under which non-preconditioned corals bleached and preconditioned corals (thermal-tolerant) maintained Symbiodinium density, a clear differentiation in the transcriptional profiles was revealed among the condition examined. Among these changes, nine differentially expressed genes separated preconditioned corals from non-preconditioned corals, with 42 genes differentially expressed between control and preconditioned treatments, and 70 genes between non-preconditioned corals and controls. Differentially expressed genes included components of an apoptotic signaling cascade, which suggest the inhibition of apoptosis in preconditioned corals. Additionally, lectins and genes involved in response to oxidative stress were also detected. One dominant pattern was the apparent tuning of gene expression observed between preconditioned and non-preconditioned treatments; that is, differences in expression magnitude were more apparent than differences in the identity of genes differentially expressed.

Transcriptome plasticity may facilitate marine organisms' acclimation to thermal and acidification stress by tailoring gene expression to mitigate the impacts of these stressors. Here, we produce the first transcriptome of the abundant, ubiquitous, and resilient Caribbean reef-building coral Siderastrea siderea, and investigate this corals' transcriptomic response to 95 days of thermal (T = 25, 28, 32 degrees C) and CO2-induced acidification (324, 477, 604, 2553 mu atm) stress. The S. siderea transcriptome was assembled using RNAseq and then Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis was employed to obtain systems-level insights into the coral's stress response. Exposure of the coral to both elevated temperature and acidification elicited strong but divergent transcriptomic responses. Gene Ontology analysis suggests that long-term thermal stress disrupts homeostasis by increasing transcription of protein-coding genes associated with protein catabolism and suppressing transcription of genes involved in responding to environmental stimuli. Both next century (604 mu atm) and extreme-high (2553 mu atm) pCO(2) stress increased transcription of genes associated with respiration, highlighting the potentially greater energetic requirements of maintaining calcification under high-pCO(2) conditions. Under extreme-high pCO(2), increased transcription of H+-transporter genes was observed, consistent with the proposed role of proton transport in facilitating coral calcification under elevated pCO(2). These results suggest that 95 days of exposure to 32 degrees C seawater elicits a more adverse transcriptomic response (i.e., broad scale reductions in gene expression) than exposure to extreme-high acidification (2553 mu atm; i.e., increased expression of genes associated with ion transport) within S. siderea-with the response to extreme warming suggesting cellular shutdown and the response to extreme acidification indicating capacity for acclimation. These results are consistent with the observation that rates of net calcification for the investigated corals were more negatively affected by the prescribed thermal stress than by the prescribed acidification stress. This study demonstrates how transcriptome plasticity may promote coral acclimation to these global change stressors, but that there are limits to the efficacy of this plasticity.","","2296-7745",NA,"",2016,3,"",NA,"","112","10.3389/fmars.2016.00112",NA,"","WOS:000457358000109",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature;acidification",2,"none",2

Nevertheless, a lack of experimentally validated, stably expressed reference genes for the normalization of gene expression using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qPCR) method limit such investigations among octocorals. Here, assessment of the expression stability of seven candidate reference genes was performed using a palette of statistical tools for valid qPCR-based gene expression studies on the octocoral Sinularia cf. cruciata during thermal (34 degrees C) and low-pH (pH 7.5) stress and the most suitable set of reference genes was determined for such experiments.

The HSP70 gene was found to be significantly upregulated during thermal stress, whereas during low-pH stress the expression level of this gene decreased. This study provides experimentally validated stress-specific sets of stably expressed reference genes during climate change-induced stresses, which will benefit future gene expression studies on Sinularia cf. cruciata as well as other octocorals.

Despite high transcriptomic variability among and within colonies, 40 genes were consistently and significantly different between tolerant and susceptible colonies, and could be potential biomarkers for thermal tolerance should they be verified in a larger sample. Overall, the results suggest that this population has substantial genetic variation for traits that directly impact thermal tolerance; however, their response to projected increases in temperature will depend on more precise estimates of the additive components of this variation (h(2)).","0171-8630","1616-1599",NA,"30-Jul",2020,646,"",45,"68","","10.3354/meps13407",NA,"","WOS:000621208500004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1

Chronic microbial-related stress has received less attention despite documented links between chronic activation of the innate immune system and the diminished capacity to respond to simultaneously acting stressors. Therefore, differential response of corals to bacterial stress may contribute to decreased coral cover indirectly. To identify differences in bacterial stress response between coral populations, Porites astreoides colonies (n=6) were collected from an adjacent inshore patch reef and offshore bank-reef of the FRT. Coral were affixed to a concrete substrate at the collection site, and remained there for 2 years to diminish reef environment interspecific effects. Coral were collected after 2 years and subjected to one of three conditions for 8h: a control condition (28 degrees C), a thermal stress treatment (32 degrees C), and thermal and bacterial stress treatment (5 mu gmL(-1)Serratia marcescens lipopolysaccharide). Offshore reef colonies displayed two- to fourfold increase in innate immune system-related gene expression following temperature stress and LPS, but not with temperature stress alone.

Despite the persistent use of mosquito control pesticides in populated coastal areas, studies examining the survival and physiological impacts of early life-history stages of non-targeted marine organisms are limited. In order to better understand the combined effects of mosquito pesticides and rising sea surface temperatures, we exposed larvae from the coral Porites astreoides to selected concentrations of two major mosquito pesticide ingredients, naled and permethrin, and seawater elevated +3.5 degrees C. Following 18-20 h of exposure, larvae exposed to naled concentrations of 2.96 mu g L-1 or greater had significantly reduced survivorship compared to controls. These effects were not detected in the presence of permethrin or elevated temperature. Furthermore, larval settlement, post-settlement survival and zooxanthellae density were not impacted by any treatment. To evaluate the sub-lethal stress response of larvae, several oxidative stress endpoints were utilized. Biomarker responses to pesticide exposure were variable and contingent upon pesticide type as well as the specific biomarker being employed. In some cases, such as with protein carbonylation and catalase gene expression, the effects of naled exposure and temperature were interactive. In other cases pesticide exposure failed to induce any sublethal stress response. Overall, these results demonstrate that P. astreoides larvae have a moderate degree of resistance against short-term exposure to ecologically relevant concentrations of pesticides even in the presence of elevated temperature.

This analysis of a single full-sibling family revealed contrasting responses between short- (4-h) and long-term (5-day) exposures to elevated temperatures. Heat shock proteins were up-regulated only in the short-term treatment, while the long-term treatment induced the down-regulation of ribosomal proteins and up-regulation of genes associated with ion transport and metabolism (Ca2+ and CO32-). We also profiled responses to settlement cues using a natural cue (crustose coralline algae, CCA) and a synthetic neuropeptide (GLW-amide). Both cues resulted in metamorphosis, accompanied by differential expression of genes with known developmental roles. Some genes were regulated only by the natural cue, which may correspond to the recruitment-associated behaviour and morphology changes that precede metamorphosis under CCA treatment, but are bypassed under GLW-amide treatment. Validation of these expression profiles using qPCR confirmed the quantitative accuracy of our RNA-Seq approach. Importantly, qPCR analysis of different larval families revealed extensive variation in these responses depending on genetic background, including qualitative differences (i.e. up-regulation in one family and down-regulation in another).

Adaptive capacities for marine species facing climate change can include individual acclimatization (during the individual life-span) and genetic selection (considered at the population level). The Mediterranean red coral, Corallium rubrum, is well suited to study adaptive evolution in heterogeneous environment. This is a sessile species, which inhabits contrasted environments with a strong genetic structure, and differential responses to thermal stress between populations. This study proposes an integrative study of the adaptive response of C. rubrum to thermal stress. To understand the underlying mechanisms of thermal adaptation in this species, we studied three populations of C rubrum from different depths (5 m, 20 m and 40 m depths) and therefore different thermal regimes in the same area. We first surveyed in situ the thermal environment and the corresponding stress levels at the different depths studied here. Then we submitted red coral colonies to different heat shocks in aquaria that mimicked in situ stresses (common garden conditions). We measured the expression levels of several candidate genes. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) showed significant differences of expression depending on the depth of origin of the individuals and of their thermal history. Based on a complementary analysis of genetic structure, our study shows the evolution of a differential response at a local scale which might be explained by local adaptation or acclimatization. Our results also underline the trade-off between fitness and potential deleterious consequences linked to heat stress response. It also strongly emphasizes the conservation value of populations living at the edge of the species' range, as they represent an irreplaceable genetic pool for evolutionary rescue.

The fragments that were subjected to heat stress (2 degrees C above ambient levels) generally exhibited significant reduction in their endosymbiont densities, but the extent of recovery following stress removal varied depending on natal site and colony. There were minimal changes in chlaconcentration and maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm, the proportion of variable fluorescence (Fv) to maximum fluorescence (Fm)) in heat-stressed corals, suggesting that the algal endosymbionts' Photosystem II was not severely compromised. Significant changes in gene expression levels of selected genes of interest (GOI) were observed following heat exposure and stress removal among sites and colonies, includingActin, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (Camk4), kinesin-like protein (KIF9), and small heat shock protein 16.1 (Hsp16.1). The most responsive GOIs wereActin, a major component of the cytoskeleton, and the adaptive immune-relatedCamk4which both showed significant reduction following heat exposure and subsequent upregulation during the recovery phase. Our findings clearly demonstrate specific responses ofP. acutain both photophysiological attributes and gene expression levels, suggesting differential capacity ofP. acutacorals to tolerate heat stress depending on the colony, so that certain colonies may be more resilient than others.","","2076-2607",NA,"AUG",2020,8,"8",NA,"","1227","10.3390/microorganisms8081227",NA,"","WOS:000568075300001",32806647,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1

Varied response to the heat-stress, in terms of visual coral paling,algal maximum quantum yield and host gene expression was evident in the different growth forms. The two branching corals exhibited similar overall responses that differed from that of the massive coral. A. eurystoma that is considered as a susceptible species did not bleach in our experiment, but tissue sloughing was evident at 34 degrees C. Interestingly, in this species redox regulation genes were up-regulated at the very onset of the thermal challenge, In S. pistillate, bleaching was evident at 3.4 degrees C and most of the stress markers were already up-regulated at 32 degrees C, either remaining highly expressed or decreasing when temperatures reached 34 degrees C. The massive Porites species displayed severe bleaching at 32 degrees C but stress marker genes were only significantly elevated at 34 degrees C. We postulate that by expelling the algal symbionts from Porites tissues, oxidation damages are reduced and stress genes are activated only at a progressed stage.

In this study, gene expression and induction of a 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) was analyzed in five common shallow-water hard corals in the Mediterranean Sea, namely Astroides calycularis, Balanophyllia europaea, Caryophyllia inornata, Cladocora caespitosa, and Leptopsammia pruvoti. The main aim was to assess the contribution of this evolutionary conserved cytoprotective mechanism to the physiological plasticity of these species that possess different growth modes (solitary vs colonial) and trophic strategies (zooxanthellate vs azooxanthellate). Using quantitative real-time PCR, in situ hsp70 baseline levels and expression profiles after a heat-shock exposure were assessed. Levels of hsp70 and heat stress induction were higher in zooxanthellate than in azooxanthellate species, and different heat stress transcriptional profiles were observed between colonial and solitary zooxanthellate corals. On the whole, the hsp70 transcriptional response to heat stress aligns with stress susceptibility of the species and suggests a contribution of trophic strategy and morphology in shaping coral resilience to stress.

In a second experiment, we identified differentially expressed genes during a time course experiment with four time points across 9 days. Results suggest that thermal stress and bleaching in M. faveolata affect the following processes: oxidative stress, Ca2+ homeostasis, cytoskeletal organization, cell death, calcification, metabolism, protein synthesis, heat shock protein activity, and transposon activity. These results represent the first medium-scale transcriptomic study focused on revealing the cellular foundation of thermal stress-induced coral bleaching.

The expression of MAPK genes in Pocillopora damicornis increased at night, while the expression of cytoskeleton genes in Seriatopora hystrix decreased. The increase in P. damicornis MAPK expression may reflect host osmolyte production in response to reduced osmotic pressure at night. The concomitant decrease in expression of genes encoding cytoskeleton proteins at night is consistent with this interpretation, indicating reduced production of spatially demanding proteins under periods of intracellular crowding. However, the latter interpretation is confounded by the fact that molecularly-inferred Symbiodinium densities were found to be significantly greater at night in both corals, so changes in cytoskeletal gene expression may also reflect crowding to accommodate the greater density of these endosymbionts.

Comparisons of temporal patterns in a range of biochemical and genetic immune parameters (Toll-like receptor signalling pathway, lectin-complement system, prophenoloxidase-activating system and green fluorescent protein-like proteins) among healthy, injured and diseased corals revealed that corals exhibit a diverse array of immune responses to environmental and anthropogenic stressors. In healthy corals at the control site, expression of genes involved in the Toll-like receptor signalling pathway (MAPK p38, MEKK1, cFos and ATF4/5) and complement system (C3 and Bf) was modulated by seasonal environmental factors in summer months. Corals at reef platform sites experienced additional stressors over the summer, as evidenced by increased expression of various immune genes, including MAPK p38 and MEKK1. Despite increased expression of immune genes, signs of white syndromes were detected in 31% of study corals near tourist platforms in the warmest summer month. Evidence that colonies developing disease showed reduced expression of genes involved in the complement pathway prior to disease onset suggests that their immune systems may have been compromised. Responses to disease and physical damage primarily involved the melanization cascade and GFP-like proteins, and appeared to be sufficient for recovery when summer heat stress subsided.

Indeed, in early ontogeny, when corals acquire and establish associations with various surface microbiota and dinoflagellate endosymbionts, they do not efficiently distinguish between closely and distantly related individuals from the same population. However, very little is known about the molecular components that underpin allorecognition and immunity responses or how they change through early ontogeny in corals. Methodology/Principal Findings: Patterns in the expression of four putative immune response genes (apextrin, complement C3, and two CELIII type lectin genes) were examined in juvenile colonies of Acropora millepora throughout a six-month post-settlement period using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Expression of a CELIII type lectin gene peaked in the fourth month for most of the coral juveniles sampled and was significantly higher at this time than at any other sampling time during the six months following settlement. The timing of this increase in expression levels of putative immune response genes may be linked to allorecognition maturation which occurs around this time in A. millepora. Alternatively, the increase may represent a response to immune challenges, such as would be involved in the recognition of symbionts (such as Symbiodinium spp. or bacteria) during winnowing processes as symbioses are fine-tuned. Conclusions/Significance: Our data, although preliminary, are consistent with the hypothesis that lectins may play an important role in the maturation of allorecognition responses in corals. The co-expression of lectins with apextrin during development of coral juveniles also raises the possibility that these proteins, which are components of innate immunity in other invertebrates, may influence the innate immune systems of corals through a common pathway or system. However, further studies investigating the expression of these genes in alloimmune-challenged corals are needed to further clarify emerging evidence of a complex innate immunity system in corals.","1932-6203","",NA,"6-Jul",2012,7,"7",NA,"","e39099","10.1371/journal.pone.0039099",NA,"","WOS:000306461800005",22792163,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

Some genes have large differences between day and night at some lunar phases, but little or no diurnal differences at other phases. Many clock genes display an oscillation pattern indicative of phase shifts linked to the lunar cycle. Time-independent methods found that signal transduction, protein secretion and modification, cell cycle and ion transport change over the lunar timescale and peak at various phases of the moon. Together these data provide unique insights into how the moon impinges on coral transcription cycles and how lunar light may regulate circalunar timing systems and coral biology.","0962-1083","1365-294X",NA,"MAY",2017,26,"9",2514,"2526","","10.1111/mec.14043",NA,"","WOS:000400335200009",28141890,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

Moonlight, rather than tides or other lunar-regulated processes, is thought to be the proximate factor responsible for linking the night of spawning to the phase of the Moon. We compared patterns of gene expression among colonies of the broadcast spawning coral Acropora millepora at different phases of the lunar cycle, and when they were maintained under one of three experimentally simulated lunar lighting treatments: i) lunar lighting conditions matching those on the reef, or lunar patterns mimicking either ii) constant full Moon conditions, or iii) constant new Moon conditions. Normal lunar illumination was found to shift both the level and timing of clock gene transcription cycles between new and full moons, with the peak hour of expression for a number of genes occurring earlier in the evening under a new Moon when compared to a full Moon. When the normal lunar cycle is replaced with nighttime patterns equivalent to either a full Moon or a new Moon every evening, the normal monthlong changes in the level of expression are destroyed for most genes. In combination, these results indicate that daily changes in moonlight that occur over the lunar cycle are essential for maintaining normal lunar periodicity of clock gene transcription, and this may play a role in regulating spawn timing.

The role of small-scale gradients in light and water flow was examined by comparing gene expression levels between branch elevation (tip and base) and position (centre and edge) of replicate coral colonies (n=3). Analyses of variance revealed that almost 60% of variation in gene expression was present between colonies and 34 genes were considered differentially expressed between colonies (minimum P=6.5 x 10(-4)). These genes are associated with energy metabolism, protein biosynthesis and cell-cell recognition representing either genotypic variation in gene expression or the effects of specific environmental conditions that affect patterns of energy acquisition, growth and pathogen encounters. Less variation was present between central and peripheral branches (7%) and only a single gene was deemed differentially expressed (P=1.493 x 10(-3)). The function of this gene, a phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, suggests different growth patterns between branch positions within colonies and is consistent with the usual higher growth rates on the perimeter of corymbose-like branching coral colonies such as A. millepora. Four genes were differentially expressed between the tip and base of branches (P=3.239 x 10(-4)) and were associated with lysosome lipase activity and fluorescence, suggesting that branch tips may encounter higher pathogen loads or levels of mechanical stress and require greater levels of photo-protection associated with higher water flow and light levels. This study therefore confirms transcriptomic variation in response to small-scale environmental gradients consistent with differential resource allocation in clonal coral colonies.

To survive, morphologically simple and sessile cnidarians have developed mechanisms to catch prey, deter predators and compete with adjacent corals for space, yet the mechanisms underlying these functions are largely unknown. Here, we characterize the histology, toxic activity and gene expression patterns in two different types of tentacles from the scleractinian coralGalaxea fascilcularis- catch tentacles (CTs), used to catch prey and deter predators, and sweeper tentacles (STs), specialized tentacles used for territorial aggression. Results STs exhibit more mucocytes and higher expression of mucin genes than CTs, and lack the ectodermal cilia used to deliver food to the mouth and remove debris. STs and CTs also express different sensory rhodopsin-like g-protein coupled receptors, suggesting they may employ different sensory pathways. Each tentacle type has a different complement of stinging cells (nematocytes), and the expression in the two tentacles of genes encoding structural nematocyte proteins suggests the stinging cells develop within the tentacles. CTs have higher neurotoxicity to blowfly larvae and hemolytic activity compared to the STs, consistent with a role in prey capture. In contrast, STs have higher phospholipase A2 activity, which we speculate may have a role in inducing tissue damage during territorial aggression. The expression of genes encoding cytolytic toxins (actinoporins) and phospholipases also differs between the tentacle types. Conclusions These results show that the same organism utilizes two distinct tentacle types, each equipped with a different venom apparatus and toxin composition, for prey capture and defense and for territorial aggression.","1471-2164","",NA,"8-Aug",2020,21,"1",NA,"","548","10.1186/s12864-020-06952-w",NA,"","WOS:000561210700001",32770938,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

In the present study we determined the complete set of aCAs in C. rubrum by data mining the genome and transcriptome, and measured their differential gene expression between calcifying and non-calcifying tissues.

One secreted isozyme (CruCA4) showed specific expression both by qPCR and western-blot in the calcifying tissues, suggesting its involvement in biomineralization.

Stringent control of [H+] is required to maintain the homeostatic acid-base balance in coral cells and is achieved through the regulation of intracellular pH (pH(i)). This task is especially challenging for reef-building corals that share an endosymbiotic relationship with photosynthetic dinoflagellates (family Symbiodinaceae), which significantly affect the pH(i) of coral cells. Despite their importance, the pH regulatory proteins involved in the homeostatic acid-base balance have been scarcely investigated in corals. Here, we report in the coral Stylophora pistillata a full characterization of the genomic structure, domain topology and phylogeny of three major H+ transporter families that are known to play a role in the intracellular pH regulation of animal cells; we investigated their tissue-specific expression patterns and assessed the effect of seawater acidification on their expression levels.

In addition, we identified a novel member of the HvCN gene family in the cnidarian subclass Hexacorallia that has not been previously described in any species. We also identified key residues that contribute to H+ transporter substrate specificity, protein function and regulation. Last, we demonstrated that some of these proteins have different tissue expression patterns, and most are unaffected by exposure to seawater acidification.

We used RNA-seq to evaluate transcriptomic differences between functionally distinct regions of the coral (apical branch tips and branch bases) in two species of Caribbean Acropora, the staghorn coral, A. cervicornis, and the elkhorn coral, A. palmata. Results: Transcriptome-wide gene profiles differed significantly between different parts of the coral colony as well as between species. Genes showing differential expression between branch tips and bases were involved in developmental signaling pathways, such as Wnt, Notch, and BMP, as well as pH regulation, ion transport, extracellular matrix production and other processes. Differences both within colonies and between species identify a relatively small number of genes that may contribute to the distinct ""staghorn"" versus ""elkhorn"" morphologies of these two sister species.

Diel rhythmicity in LB size and distribution was observed; solar irradiation onset at sunrise initiated an increase in LB formation, which continued throughout the day and peaked after sunset at 18:00. The LBs migrated from the area near the mesoglea to the gastrodermal cell border near the coelenteron. Micro-LB biogenesis occurred in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the host gastrodermal cells. A transcriptomic analysis of genes related to lipogenesis indicated that binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) plays a key role in metabolic signaling pathways. The diel rhythmicity of LB biogenesis was correlated with ER-localized BiP expression. BiP expression peaked during the period with the largest increase in LB formation, thereby indicating that the chaperoning reaction of abnormal protein folding inside the host ER is likely involved in LB biosynthesis.

To examine the molecular response of the coral Acropora microphthalma to high levels of solar irradiance, a cDNA library was constructed by PCR-based suppression subtractive hybridisation (PCR-SSH) from mRNA obtained by transplantation of a colony from a depth of 12.7 m to near-surface solar irradiance, during which the coral became noticeably paler from loss of endosymbionts in sun-exposed tissues. Methodology/Principal Findings: A novel approach to sequence annotation of the cDNA library gave genetic evidence for a hypothetical biosynthetic pathway branching from the shikimic acid pathway that leads to the formation of 4-deoxygadusol. This metabolite is a potent antioxidant and expected precursor of the UV-protective mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), which serve as sunscreens in coral phototrophic symbiosis. Empirical PCR based evidence further upholds the contention that the biosynthesis of these MAA sunscreens is a 'shared metabolic adaptation' between the symbiotic partners. Additionally, gene expression induced by enhanced solar irradiance reveals a cellular mechanism of light-induced coral bleaching that invokes a Ca2+-binding synaptotagmin-like regulator of SNARE protein assembly of phagosomal exocytosis, whereby algal partners are lost from the symbiosis. Conclusions/Significance: Bioinformatics analyses of DNA sequences obtained by differential gene expression of a coral exposed to high solar irradiance has revealed the identification of putative genes encoding key steps of the MAA biosynthetic pathway. Revealed also by this treatment are genes that implicate exocytosis as a cellular process contributing to a breakdown in the metabolically essential partnership between the coral host and endosymbiotic algae, which manifests as coral bleaching.","1932-6203","",NA,"12-Nov",2010,5,"11",NA,"","e13975","10.1371/journal.pone.0013975",NA,"","WOS:000284147700020",21103042,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UVR",1,"none",1

Elevated CO2 has been hypothesized to benefit photosynthetic organisms but expression changes of in hos-pite Symbiodinium in response to acidification were greater and less consistent among reef populations. This population-specific response suggests hosts may need to adapt not only to an acidified environment, but also to changes in their Symbiodinium populations that may not be consistent among environments, adding another challenging dimension to the physiological process of coping with climate change.","1354-1013","1365-2486",NA,"JAN",2018,24,"1",158,"171","","10.1111/gcb.13833",NA,"","WOS:000426506100042",28727232,NA,NA,NA,NA,"acidification",1,"none",1

Marine calcifying organisms, including stony corals, are expected to be the most affected by the predicted decrease of the surface water pH at the end of the century. The severity of the impacts on coral reefs remains as a matter of controversy. Although previous studies have explored the physiological response of stony corals to changes in pH, the response of the holobiont (i.e., the coral itself plus its symbionts) remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we assessed the changes in overall gene expression of the coral Montipora digitata and its microalgal symbionts after a short (3 days) and a longer (42 days) exposure to low pH (7.6). The short-term exposure to low pH caused small differences in the expression level of the host, impacting mostly genes associated with stress response in other scleractinians. Longer exposure to low pH resulted in no significant changes in gene expression of treated vs. control coral hosts. Gene expression in the eukaryotic symbionts remained unaltered at both exposure times. Our findings suggest resilience, in terms of gene expression, of the M. digitata holobiont to pH decrease, as well as capability to acclimatize to extended periods of exposure to low pH.","","2296-7745",NA,"",2017,4,"",NA,"","403","10.3389/fmars.2017.00403",NA,"","WOS:000457690600400",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"acidification",1,"none",1

Ocean acidification (OA) involving decreasing pH and changes in seawater carbonate chemistry challenges the capacity of corals to form their skeletons. Despite the large number of studies that have investigated how rates of calcification respond to ocean acidification scenarios, comparatively few studies tackle how ocean acidification impacts the physiological mechanisms that drive calcification itself. The aim of our paper was to determine how the carbonic anhydrases, which play a major role in calcification, are potentially regulated by ocean acidification. For this we measured the effect of pH on enzyme activity of two carbonic anhydrase isoforms that have been previously characterized in the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. In addition we looked at gene expression of these enzymes in vivo. For both isoforms, our results show (1) a change in gene expression under OA (2) an effect of OA and temperature on carbonic anhydrase activity. We suggest that temperature increase could counterbalance the effect of OA on enzyme activity. Finally we point out that caution must, thus, be taken when interpreting transcriptomic data on carbonic anhydrases in ocean acidification and temperature stress experiments, as the effect of these stressors on the physiological function of CA will depend both on gene expression and enzyme activity.","","1660-3397",NA,"JUN",2016,14,"6",NA,"","109","10.3390/md14060109",NA,"","WOS:000378770300006",27271641,NA,NA,NA,NA,"acidification",1,"none",1

In our study, pH and temperature conditions consistent with the end-of-century scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) caused major changes in photosynthesis and respiration, in addition to decreased calcification rates in the coral Acropora millepora. Population density of symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium) under high levels of ocean acidification and temperature (Representative Concentration Pathway, RCP8.5) decreased to half of that found under present day conditions, with photosynthetic and respiratory rates also being reduced by 40%. These physiological changes were accompanied by evidence for gene regulation of calcium and bicarbonate transporters along with components of the organic matrix.

Whether corals are damaged by these interactions depends on susceptibility of the coral and traits of macroalgal competitors. Investigating changes in gene expression of corals and their intracellular symbiotic algae, Symbiodinium, in response to contact with different macroalgae provides insight into the biological processes and cellular pathways affected by competition with macroalgae. We evaluated the gene expression profiles of coral and Symbiodinium genes from two confamilial corals, Acropora millepora and Montipora digitata, after 6 h and 48 h of contact with four common macroalgae that differ in their allelopathic potency to corals. Contacts with macroalgae affected different biological pathways in the more susceptible (A. millepora) versus the more resistant (M. digitata) coral. Genes of coral hosts and of their associated Symbiodinium also responded in species-specific and time-specific ways to each macroalga. Changes in number and expression intensity of affected genes were greater after 6 h compared to 48 h of contact and were greater following contact with Chlorodesmis fastigiata and Amphiroa crassa than following contact with Galaxaura filamentosa or Turbinaria conoides. We documented a divergence in transcriptional responses between two confamilial corals and their associated Symbiodinium, as well as a diversity of dynamic responses within each coral species with respect to the species of macroalgal competitor and the duration of exposure to that competitor. These responses included early initiation of immune processes by Montipora, which is more resistant to damage after long-term macroalgal contact. Activation of the immune response by corals that better resist algal competition is consistent with the hypothesis that some macroalgal effects on corals may be mediated by microbial pathogens.","1932-6203","",NA,"12-Dec",2014,9,"12",NA,"","e114525","10.1371/journal.pone.0114525",NA,"","WOS:000346375400034",25500576,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

In this study, a focused. anthozoan holobiont microarray was used to detect early and sub-lethal effects of spatial and temporal environmental changes on gene expression patterns in the scleractinian coral, Montastraea cavernosa, on south Florida reefs. Although all colonies appeared healthy (i.e. no visible tissue necrosis or bleaching), corals were differentially physiologically compensating for exposure to stressors that varied over time. Corals near the Port of Miami inlet experienced significant changes in expression of stress responsive and symbiont (zooxanthella)-specific genes after periods of heavy precipitation. In contrast, coral populations did not demonstrate stress responses during periods of increased water temperature (up to 29 degrees C). Specific acute and long-term localized responses to other stressors were also evident. A correlation between stress response genes and symbiont-specific genes was also observed, possibly indicating early processes involved in the maintenance or disruption of the coral zooxanthella symbiosis. This is the first study to reveal spatially- and temporally-related variation in gene expression in response to different stressors of in situ coral populations, and demonstrates that microarray technology can be used to detect specific sub-lethal physiological responses to specific environmental conditions that are not visually detectable.

No significant changes were observed in the density of symbiotic zooxanthellae during the entire period of microplastic exposure, while its chlorophyll content increased significantly at 12 h of micro plastic exposure. We observed significant increases in the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, significant decrease in the detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase and the immune enzyme alkaline phosphatase, but no change in the other immune enzyme phenoloxidase during the whole experiment period. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 134 significantly up-regulated coral genes at 12 h after the exposure, enriched in 11 GO terms mostly related to stress response, zymogen granule, and JNK signal pathway. Meanwhile, 215 coral genes were significantly down-regulated at 12 h after exposure, enriched in 25 GO terms involved in sterol transport and EGF-ERK1/2 signal pathway. In contrast, only 12 zooxanthella genes exhibited significant up-regulation and 95 genes down-regulation at 12 h after the microplastic exposure; genes regulating synthesis and export of glucose and amino acids were not impacted. These results suggest that acute exposure of microplastics can activate the stress response of the scleractinian coral P. damicomis, and repress its detoxification and immune system through the JNK and ERK signal pathways. These demonstrate that microplastic exposure can compromise the anti-stress capacity and immune system of the scleractinian coral P. damicornis, despite the minimal impact on the abundance and major photosynthate translocation transporters of the symbiont in the short term.

We identified individual colonies that demonstrated resistance or susceptibility to Vibrio spp. in a controlled laboratory environment. Long-term growth patterns suggest no trade-off between disease resistance and calcification. Predictive (pre-exposure) gene expression highlights subtle differences between resistant and susceptible genets, encouraging future coral disease studies to investigate associations between resistance and replicative age and immune cell populations. Predictive gene expression associated with long-term growth underscores the role of transmembrane proteins involved in cell adhesion and cell-cell interactions, contributing to the growing body of knowledge surrounding genes that influence calcification in reef-building corals. Together these results demonstrate that coral genets from isolated sanctuaries such as FGBNMS can withstand pathogen challenges and potentially aid restoration efforts in degraded reefs.

We investigated integrated-responses among coral and zooxanthellae in the scleractinian coral Acropora formosa in response to an emerging marine pollutant, the munitions constituent, 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5 triazine (RDX; 5 day exposures to 0 (control), 0.5, 0.9, 1.8, 3.7, and 7.2 mg/L, measured in seawater). Results: RDX accumulated readily in coral soft tissues with bioconcentration factors ranging from 1.1 to 1.5. Next-generation sequencing of a normalized meta-transcriptomic library developed for the eukaryotic components of the A. formosa coral holobiont was leveraged to conduct microarray-based global transcript expression analysis of integrated coral/zooxanthellae responses to the RDX exposure. Total differentially expressed transcripts (DET) increased with increasing RDX exposure concentrations as did the proportion of zooxanthellae DET relative to the coral animal. Transcriptional responses in the coral demonstrated higher sensitivity to RDX compared to zooxanthellae where increased expression of gene transcripts coding xenobiotic detoxification mechanisms (i.e. cytochrome P450 and UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family) were initiated at the lowest exposure concentration. Increased expression of these detoxification mechanisms was sustained at higher RDX concentrations as well as production of a physical barrier to exposure through a 40% increase in mucocyte density at the maximum RDX exposure. At and above the 1.8 mg/L exposure concentration, DET coding for genes involved in central energy metabolism, including photosynthesis, glycolysis and electron-transport functions, were decreased in zooxanthellae although preliminary data indicated that zooxanthellae densities were not affected. In contrast, significantly increased transcript expression for genes involved in cellular energy production including glycolysis and electron-transport pathways was observed in the coral animal. Conclusions: Transcriptional network analysis for central energy metabolism demonstrated highly correlated responses to RDX among the coral animal and zooxanthellae indicative of potential compensatory responses to lost photosynthetic potential within the holobiont. These observations underscore the potential for complex integrated responses to RDX exposure among species comprising the coral holobiont and highlight the need to understand holobiont-species interactions to accurately assess pollutant impacts.","1471-2164","",NA,"12-Jul",2014,15,"",NA,"","591","10.1186/1471-2164-15-591",NA,"","WOS:000339587100002",25016412,NA,NA,NA,NA,"pollutants",1,"none",1

Irgarol 1051, a PSII herbicide, has been used as an antifouling booster since the previously used antibiofouling agent tributyltin (TBT) was banned worldwide. Although the mechanisms through which elevated temperatures cause coral bleaching have been reported, it remains unclear how PSII herbicides cause bleaching. Thus, in this study, we investigated the transcriptomes of Acropora tenuis and its symbiotic dinoflagellates by RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying Irgarolinduced bleaching. Coral exposure to 10 mu g/L Irgarol for 7 d affected coral body colour, specifically by an increase in their red, green, and blue (RGB) values; however, no such effect was observed in corals exposed to 1 mu g/L Irgarol. RNA-Seq revealed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in corals and symbiotic dinoflagellates following Irgarol exposure. Coral DEGs encoded green fluorescent protein, blue-light-sensing photoreceptor (cryptochrome), chromoprotein, caspase 8, and nuclear receptors; DEGs in symbiotic dinoflagellates encoded light-harvesting proteins, photosystem II proteins, and heat shock proteins (i.e. HSP70 and HSP90), and ubiquitin. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that both Irgarol treatments disrupted various gene ontology terms, pathways, and protein interaction networks; these are different in corals (e.g. oxidative phosphorylation, metabolic pathway, transforming growth factor-beta signalling pathway, adherens junction, and apoptosis) and symbiotic dinoflagellates (e.g. protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, metabolic pathway, and photosynthesis). Our data suggest that Irgarol disrupts the expression of various coral genes, thereby affecting various gene ontology terms, pathways, and protein interaction networks. Our study provides new insights into the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the bleaching effect of PSII herbicides, such as Irgarol, on corals and symbiotic dinoflagellates.

However, a mortality event, affecting 5.6 ha (2.6% of the area) of the East FGB, occurred in late July 2016 and coincided with storm-generated freshwater runoff extending offshore and over the reef system. To capture the immediate effects of storm-driven freshwater runoff on coral and symbiont physiology, we leveraged the heavy rainfall associated with Hurricane Harvey in late August 2017 by sampling FGB corals at two time points: September 2017, when surface water salinity was reduced (similar to 34 ppt); and 1 month later when salinity had returned to typical levels (similar to 36 ppt in October 2017). Tissue samples (N = 47) collected midday were immediately preserved for gene expression profiling from two congeneric coral species (Orbicella faveolata and Orbicella franksi) from the East and West FGB to determine the physiological consequences of storm-derived runoff. In the coral, differences between host species and sampling time points accounted for the majority of differentially expressed genes. Gene ontology enrichment for genes differentially expressed immediately after Hurricane Harvey indicated increases in cellular oxidative stress responses. Although tissue loss was not observed on FGB reefs following Hurricane Harvey, our results suggest that poor water quality following this storm caused FGB corals to experience sub-lethal stress. We also found dramatic expression differences across sampling time points in the coral's algal symbiont, Breviolum minutum. Some of these differentially expressed genes may be involved in the symbionts' response to changing environments, including a group of differentially expressed post-transcriptional RNA modification genes. In this study, we cannot disentangle the effects of reduced salinity from the collection time point, so these expression patterns could also be related to seasonality. These findings highlight the urgent need for continued monitoring of these reef systems to establish a baseline for gene expression of healthy corals in the FGB system across seasons, as well as the need for integrated solutions to manage stormwater runoff in the Gulf of Mexico.","","2296-7745",NA,"5-Nov",2019,6,"",NA,"","672","10.3389/fmars.2019.00672",NA,"","WOS:000493934500001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"salinity",1,"none",1

However, the genetic basis of this life history change remains poorly understood in many taxa, including most coral species. Recent evidence suggests that coral planula larvae undergo significant changes at the physiological and molecular levels throughout the development. To investigate this, we characterized differential gene expression (DGE) during the transition from planula to adult polyp in the abundant Caribbean reef-building coral Porites astreoides, that is from nonprobing to actively substrate-probing larva, a stage required for colony initiation. This period is crucial for the coral, because it demonstrates preparedness to locate appropriate substrata for settlement based on vital environmental cues. Through RNA-Seq, we identified 860 differentially expressed holobiont genes between probing and nonprobing larvae (p <= .01), the majority of which were upregulated in probing larvae. Surprisingly, differentially expressed genes of endosymbiotic dinoflagellate origin greatly outnumbered coral genes, compared with a nearly 1:1 ratio of coral-to-dinoflagellate gene representation in the holobiont transcriptome. This unanticipated result suggests that dinoflagellate endosymbionts may play a significant role in the transition from nonprobing to probing behaviour in dinoflagellate-rich larvae. Putative holobiont genes were largely involved in protein and nucleotide binding, metabolism and transport. Genes were also linked to environmental sensing and response and integral signalling pathways. Our results thus provide detailed insight into molecular changes prior to larval settlement and highlight the complex physiological and biochemical changes that occur in early transition stages from pelagic to benthic stages in corals, and perhaps more importantly, in their endosymbionts.","0962-1083","1365-294X",NA,"NOV",2019,28,"22",4899,"4913","","10.1111/mec.15265",NA,"Oct-19","WOS:000492884500001",31596993,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

We characterized the genomic basis of this adaptation in both coral hosts and their intracellular symbionts (Symbiodinium sp.) using genome-wide gene expression profiling. Populations differed primarily in their capacity for plasticity: following transplantation to a novel environment, inshore-origin coral expression profiles became significantly more similar to the local population's profiles than those in offshore-origin corals. Furthermore, elevated plasticity of the environmental stress response expression was correlated with lower susceptibility to a natural summer bleaching event, suggesting that plasticity is adaptive in the inshore environment.

Using the bioinformatics tool Seurat, symbiotic cells were further clustered into five groups, 52 genes exhibited differential expression between groups. We proposed an index called the ""symbiosis index"", to indicate the degree of gene expression of both species in a single symbiotic cell. Interestingly, the index differed distinctly among the five groups. The symbiosis index was highly correlated with the expression of the coral gene gfas1.m1.6761 (ANKRD40), which encodes ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 40 and is involved in DNA replication (r = 0.76).

Upregulated gene expression of transporters for those metabolites occurred only when coral larvae acquired their natural symbionts, suggesting active utilization of native symbionts by host corals.

However, molecular mechanisms governing these critical processes under ocean warming and acidification are still poorly understood. The present study investigated the interactive impact of elevated temperature (similar to 28.0 degrees C and similar to 30.5 degrees C) and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) (similar to 600 and similar to 1,200 mu atm) on early development and the gene expression patterns in juvenileAcropora intermediaover 33 days. The results showed that coral survival was >89% and was unaffected by high temperature,pCO(2), or the combined treatment. Notably, high temperature completely arrested successful symbiosis establishment and the budding process, whereas acidification had a negligible effect. Moreover, there was a positive exponential relationship between symbiosis establishment and budding rates (y= 0.0004e(6.43x),R= 0.72,P< 0.0001), which indicated the importance of symbiosis in fueling asexual budding. Compared with corals at the control temperature (28 degrees C), those under elevated temperature preferentially harboredDurusdiniumspp., despite unsuccessful symbiosis establishment. In addition, compared to the control, 351 and 153 differentially expressed genes were detected in the symbiont and coral host in response to experimental conditions, respectively. In coral host, some genes involved in nutrient transportation and tissue fluorescence were affected by high temperature. In the symbionts, a suite of genes related to cell growth, ribosomal proteins, photosynthesis, and energy production was downregulated under high temperatures, which may have severely hampered successful cell proliferation of the endosymbionts and explains the failure of symbiosis establishment. Therefore, our results suggest that the responses of symbionts to future ocean conditions could play a vital role in shaping successful symbiosis in juvenile coral.","1664-302X","",NA,"30-Sep",2020,11,"",NA,"","532447","10.3389/fmicb.2020.532447",NA,"","WOS:000578302300001",33117302,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature;acidification;temp x OA",3,"interaction",2

Global ocean change threatens the success of larval dispersal and settlement by challenging the performance of the larvae and of the symbiosis. In this study, larvae of the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicomis were exposed to elevated pCO(2) and temperature to examine the performance of the coral and its symbionts in situ and better understand the mechanisms of physiological plasticity and stress tolerance in response to multiple stressors. We generated a de novo holobiont transcriptome containing coral host and algal symbiont transcripts and bioinformatically filtered the assembly into host and symbiont components for downstream analyses. Seventeen coral genes were differentially expressed in response to the combined effects of pCO(2) and temperature. In the symbiont, 89 genes were differentially expressed in response to pCO(2). Our results indicate that many of the whole-organism (holobiont) responses previously observed for P damicornis larvae in scenarios of ocean acidification and warming may reflect the physiological capacity of larvae to cope with the environmental changes without expressing additional protective mechanisms.

Corals were sampled at the end of the heat stress as well as after a recovery period at baseline temperature. Changes in coral host and symbiotic algal gene expression were determined via RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq). Shifts in coral microbiome composition were detected by complementary DNA (cDNA)-based 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. In all experiments up to 32 degrees C, RNA-Seq revealed fast and pervasive changes in gene expression, primarily in the coral host, followed by a return to baseline gene expression for the majority of coral (>94%) and algal (>71%) genes during recovery. At 34.5 degrees C, large differences in gene expression were observed with minimal recovery, high coral mortality, and a microbiome dominated by opportunistic bacteria (including Vibrio species), indicating that a lethal temperature threshold had been crossed. Our results show that the S. pistillata holobiont can mount a rapid and pervasive gene expression response contingent on the amplitude and duration of the thermal stress. We propose that the transcriptomic resilience and transcriptomic acclimation observed are key to the extraordinary thermal tolerance of this holobiont and, by inference, of other northern Red Sea coral holobionts, up to seawater temperatures of at least 32 degrees C, that is, 5 degrees C above their current maximum monthly mean.","0027-8424","",NA,"11-May",2021,118,"19",NA,"","e2023298118","10.1073/pnas.2023298118",NA,"","WOS:000651328500007",33941698,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1

To gain insight into the subcellular pathways utilized by both the coral hosts and their mutualistic Symbiodinium populations to acclimate to this temperature, mRNAs from both control (27 degrees C) and high (30 degrees C)-temperature samples were sequenced on an Illumina platform and assembled into a 236 435-contig transcriptome. These P.damicornis specimens were found to be similar to 60% anthozoan and 40% microbe (Symbiodinium, other eukaryotic microbes, and bacteria), from an mRNA-perspective. Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of genes from the Symbiodinium compartment were differentially expressed after twoweeks of exposure. Specifically, at elevated temperatures, Symbiodinium populations residing within the coral gastrodermal tissues were more likely to up-regulate the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in metabolism than their coral hosts.

To address this issue, while simultaneously developing a molecular platform for studying one of the most common Taiwanese reef corals, Seriatopora hystrix, 1,092 cDNA clones were sequenced and characterized. Subsequently, RNA, DNA and protein were extracted sequentially from colonies exposed to elevated (30 degrees C) temperature for 48 hours. From the RNA phase, a heat shock protein-70 (hsp70)-like gene, deemed hsp/c, was identified in the coral host, and expression of this gene was measured with real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) in both the host anthozoan and endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (genus Symbiodinium). While mRNA levels were not affected by temperature in either member, hsp/c expression was temporally variable in both and co-varied within biopsies. From the DNA phase, host and Symbiodinium hsp/c genome copy proportions (GCPs) were calculated to track changes in the biological composition of the holobiont during the experiment. While there was no temperature effect on either host or Symbiodinium GCP, both demonstrated significant temporal variation. Finally, total soluble protein was responsive to neither temperature nor exposure time, though the protein/DNA ratio varied significantly over time. Collectively, it appears that time, and not temperature, is a more important driver of the variation in these parameters, highlighting the need to consider natural variation in both gene expression and the molecular make-up of coral holobionts when conducting manipulative studies.

Here, we quantify the effects of long-term (95-day) thermal and CO2-acidification stress on photochemical efficiency of in hospite Symbiodinium within the coral Siderastrea siderea, along with corresponding coral color intensity, for corals from two reef zones (forereef, nearshore) on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. We then explore the molecular responses of in hospite Symbiodinium to these stressors via genome-wide gene expression profiling. Elevated temperatures reduced symbiont photochemical efficiencies and were highly correlated with coral color loss. However, photochemical efficiencies of forereef symbionts were more negatively affected by thermal stress than nearshore symbionts, suggesting greater thermal tolerance and/or reduced photodamage in nearshore corals. At control temperatures, CO2-acidification had little effect on symbiont physiology, although forereef symbionts exhibited constitutively higher photochemical efficiencies than nearshore symbionts. Gene expression profiling revealed that S. siderea were dominated by Symbiodinium goreaui (C1), except under thermal stress, which caused shifts to thermotolerant Symbiodinium trenchii (D1a). Comparative transcriptomics of conserved genes across the host and symbiont revealed few differentially expressed S. goreaui genes when compared to S. siderea, highlighting the host's role in the coral's response to environmental stress. Although S. goreaui transcriptomes did not vary in response to acidification stress, their gene expression was strongly dependent on reef zone, with forereef S. goreaui exhibiting enrichment of genes associated with photosynthesis.

Understanding how elevated temperatures and nutrient concentration affect early transcriptional changes in corals and their algal endosymbionts is critically important for evaluating the responses of coral reefs to global changes happening in the environment. Here, we investigated the expression of genes in colonies of the reef-building coral Acropora aspera exposed to short-term sub-lethal levels of thermal (+6 degrees C) and nutrient stress (ammonium-enrichment: 20 mu M). Results: The RNA-Seq data provided hundreds of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) corresponding to various stress regimes, with 115 up- and 78 down-regulated genes common to all stress regimes. A list of DEGs included up- regulated coral genes like cytochrome c oxidase and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase and up- regulated photosynthetic genes of algal origin, whereas coral GFP-like fluorescent chromoprotein and sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase showed reduced transcript levels. Taxonomic analyses of the coral holobiont disclosed the dominant presence of transcripts from coral (similar to 70%) and Symbiodinium (similar to 10-12%), as well as similar to 15-20% of unknown sequences which lacked sequence identity to known genes. Gene ontology analyses revealed enriched pathways, which led to changes in the dynamics of protein networks affecting growth, cellular processes, and energy requirement. Conclusions: In corals with preserved symbiont physiological performance (based on Fv/Fm, photo-pigment and symbiont density), transcriptomic changes and DEGs provided important insight into early stages of the stress response in the coral holobiont. Although there were no signs of coral bleaching after exposure to short-term thermal and nutrient stress conditions, we managed to detect oxidative stress and apoptotic changes on a molecular level and provide a list of prospective stress biomarkers for both partners in symbiosis.

Comparative analyses suggested that corals and their algal symbionts were more responsive to thermal stress than to estuarine discharge, although there was evidence of a synergistic relationship between the two stressors.

However, certain species are thermally resilient and can quickly adapt to anomalous thermal stress events by altering the expression of heat stress-related genes, known as gene expression plasticity. Here, we examined the expression of key genes (i.e., heat-shock proteins, oxidative stress, immune response, ion transport, apoptosis, anti-apoptosis) in the scleractinian submassive coral Porites harrisoni and cytochrome P450 gene of its algal symbionts collected from the northeastern Persian Gulf during warm (August) and cold (December) periods. The potential for recovery from severe heat stress in August was additionally examined through transplantation of partially bleached coral fragments from shallow (similar to 2.5 m) to a deeper site (similar to 9 m), close to colonies of the same species experiencing much less heat stress. To evaluate the acclimation capability, several healthy deep (similar to 9 m) coral fragments were transplanted to the shallow (similar to 2.5 m) site experiencing severe heat stress. A significant upregulation of heat-shock proteins in response to heat stress was found and identified as the primary defense mechanism against heat stress-induced bleaching. In conjunction with the apoptotic gene downregulation, the immune response gene in acclimation samples showed pronounced upregulation, indicating high compatibility of deep corals to thermal changes. In recovery samples, the expression of the studied genes was similar to the expression of samples that underwent much less heat stress, which implies they were fully recovered. The expression of the cytochrome P450 gene showed no significant changes in all experiments. Overall, the findings suggest that P. harrisoni in the Persian Gulf is a thermal-tolerant species compared with counterpart species elsewhere in the world and can be classified as a thermally resilient coral. Thus, transplanting P. harrisoni in warm regions, where native corals have been subjected to climate change-driven mortality, might maintain the coral community under enhanced global warming scenarios.","0722-4028","1432-0975",NA,"",2021,NA,"",NA,"","","10.1007/s00338-021-02100-2",NA,"Apr-21","WOS:000642846700002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1

Here we for the first time used quantitative PCR to simultaneously examine the gene expression response of orthologs of the coral Acropora aspera and their dinoflagellate symbiont Symbiodinium. During an experimental bleaching event significant up-regulation of genes involved in stress response (HSP90 and HSP70) and carbon metabolism (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase) from the coral host were observed. In contrast in the symbiont, HSP90 expression decreased, while HSP70 levels were increased on only one day, and only the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase expression levels were found to increase. In addition the changes seen in expression patterns of the coral host were much larger, up to 10.5 fold, compared to the symbiont response, which in all cases was less than 2-fold. This targeted study of the expression of key metabolic and stress genes demonstrates that the response of the coral and their symbiont vary significantly, also a response in the host transcriptome was observed prior to what has previously been thought to be the temperatures at which thermal stress events occur.","1932-6203","",NA,"24-Oct",2011,6,"10",NA,"","e26687","10.1371/journal.pone.0026687",NA,"","WOS:000296515200041",22039532,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1

This octocoral has been observed to grow over both live and dead scleractinians and to dominate certain reefs in the Indo-Pacific region. The molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of H. coerulea to tolerate warmer seawater temperatures and to effectively compete for space on the substrate remain to be elucidated. Methods: In this study, we subjected H. coerulea colonies to various temperatures for up to 3 weeks. The growth and photosynthetic efficiency rates of the coral colonies were measured. We then conducted pairwise comparisons of gene expression among the different coral tissue regions to identify genes and pathways that are expressed under different temperature conditions. Results: A horizontal growth rate of 1.13 +/- 0.25 mm per week was observed for corals subjected to 28 or 31 degrees C. This growth rate was significantly higher compared to corals exposed at 26 degrees C. This new growth was characterized by the extension of whitish tissue at the edges of the colony and was enriched for a matrix metallopeptidase, a calcium and integrin binding protein, and other transcripts with unknown function. Tissues at the growth margin and the adjacent calcified encrusting region were enriched for transcripts related to proline and riboflavin metabolism, nitrogen utilization, and organic cation transport. The calcified digitate regions, on the other hand, were enriched for transcripts encoding proteins involved in cell-matrix adhesion, translation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, photosynthesis, and ion transport. Functions related to lipid biosynthesis, extracellular matrix formation, cell migration, and oxidation-reduction processes were enriched at the growth margin in corals subjected for 3 weeks to 28 or 31 degrees C relative to corals at 26 degrees C. In the digitate region of the coral, transcripts encoding proteins that protect against oxidative stress, modify cell membrane composition, and mediate intercellular signaling pathways were enriched after just 24 h of exposure to 31 degrees C compared to corals at 28 degrees C. The overall downregulation of gene expression observed after 3 weeks of sustained exposure to 31 degrees C is likely compensated by symbiont metabolism. Discussion: These findings reveal that the different regions of H. coerulea have variable gene expression profiles and responses to temperature variation. Under warmer conditions, the blue coral invests cellular resources toward extracellular matrix formation and cellular migration at the colony margins, which may promote rapid tissue growth and extension. This mechanism enables the coral to colonize adjacent reef substrates and successfully overgrow slower growing scleractinian corals that may already be more vulnerable to warming ocean waters.","2167-8359","",NA,"27-Sep",2019,7,"",NA,"","e7785","10.7717/peerj.7785",NA,"","WOS:000487976900007",31579631,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1

The interaction of temperature and lunar day together had the largest influence on gene expression. Mean timing of planulation, which occurred at lunar days 7.4 and 12.5 for 28- and 23 degrees C- treated corals, respectively, was associated with an upregulation of transcripts in individual temperature treatments. Expression profiles of planulation-associated genes were compared between temperature treatments, revealing that elevated temperatures disrupted expression profiles associated with planulation.

Specifically, several key physiological processes in the host appear more active toward branch tips including several metabolic pathways, toxin production for prey capture or defense, and biomolecular mechanisms of biomineralization. Further, the increase in gene expression related to these processes toward branch tips is conserved between S. pistillata and Acropora spp. The photosymbiont appears to respond transcriptionally to relative light intensity along the branch and due to cardinal direction. These differential responses were observed across the colony despite its genetic homogeneity and likely inter-polyp communication.

Yet, little is known about the impacts of coral bleaching on the coral immune system. In this study, whole transcriptome analysis of the coral holobiont and each of the associate components (i.e. coral host, algal symbiont and other associated microorganisms) was used to determine changes in gene expression in corals affected by a natural bleaching event as well as during the recovery phase. The main findings include evidence that the coral holobiont and the coral host have different responses to bleaching, and the host immune system appears suppressed even a year after a bleaching event. These results support the hypothesis that coral bleaching changes the expression of innate immune genes of corals, and these effects can last even after recovery of symbiont populations.

Here we used next-generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to produce a transcriptome-wide profile of the immune response of the Staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis to White Band Disease (WBD) by comparing infected versus healthy (asymptomatic) coral tissues. The transcriptome of A. cervicornis was assembled de novo from A-tail selected Illumina mRNA-seq data from whole coral tissues, and parsed bioinformatically into coral and non-coral transcripts using existing Acropora genomes in order to identify putative coral transcripts. Differentially expressed transcripts were identified in the coral and non-coral datasets to identify genes that were up-and down-regulated due to disease infection. RNA-seq analyses indicate that infected corals exhibited significant changes in gene expression across 4% (1,805 out of 47,748 transcripts) of the coral transcriptome. The primary response to infection included transcripts involved in macrophage-mediated pathogen recognition and ROS production, two hallmarks of phagocytosis, as well as key mediators of apoptosis and calcium homeostasis. The strong up-regulation of the enzyme allene oxide synthase-lipoxygenase suggests a key role of the allene oxide pathway in coral immunity. Interestingly, none of the three primary innate immune pathways - Toll-like receptors (TLR), Complement, and prophenoloxydase pathways, were strongly associated with the response of A. cervicornis to infection. Five-hundred and fifty differentially expressed non-coral transcripts were classified as metazoan (n = 84), algal or plant (n = 52), fungi (n = 24) and protozoans (n = 13).

In addition, among the five metals, Fe2+ deficiency exhibited the strongest influence, with Fe-rich redox elements and many antioxidant synthesis genes being markedly down-regulated, indicative of adaptive reduction of Fe demand but a compromised ability to combat oxidative stress. Overall, deficiency of trace metals (especially Fe) seems to repress growth and ability of ROS scavenging, elevate energy metabolism and innate immunity, and alter cell adhesion capability, with implications in symbiosis disruption and coral bleaching.

Trophic plasticity of Symbiodiniaceae is critical to its ecological success as it moves between environments. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these trophic shifts in Symbiodiniaceae are still largely unknown. Using Breviolum minutum strain SSB01 (designated SSB01) as a model, we showed that Symbiodiniaceae go through a physiological and transcriptome reprogramming when the alga is grown with the organic nitrogen containing nutrients in hydrolyzed casein, but not with inorganic nutrients. SSB01 grows at a much faster rate and maintains stable photosynthetic efficiency when supplemented with casein amino acids compared to only inorganic nutrients or seawater. These physiological changes are driven by massive transcriptome changes in SSB01 supplemented with casein amino acids. The levels of transcripts encoding proteins involved in altering DNA conformation such as DNA topoisomerases, histones, and chromosome structural components were all significantly changed. Functional enrichment analysis also revealed processes involved in translation, ion transport, generation of second messengers, and phosphorylation. The physiological and molecular changes that underlie in vitro trophic transitions in Symbiodiniaceae can serve as an orthogonal platform to further understand the factors that impact the Symbiodiniaceae lifestyle.","1664-042X","",NA,"19-Nov",2020,11,"",NA,"","574654","10.3389/fphys.2020.574654",NA,"","WOS:000595114600001",33329024,NA,NA,NA,NA,"nutrients",1,"none",1

Offshore coral fragments displayed significantly higher expression in Symbiodinium spp. genes PCNA, SCP2, G3PDH, PCP and psaE than their inshore counterparts (p<0.05), a pattern consistent with increased bleaching susceptibility in offshore corals. Additionally, gene expression patterns in Symbiodinium spp. from site of origin were conserved throughout the two-year reciprocal transplant, indicating acclimatization did not occur within this multi-season time frame. Further, laboratory experiments were used to investigate the influence of acute high temperature (32 degrees C for eight hours) and disease (lipopolysaccharide of Serratia marcescens) on the five metabolically related symbiont genes from the same offshore and inshore P. astreoides fragments. Gene expression did not differ between reef fragments, or as a consequence of acute exposure to heat or heat and disease, contrasting to results found in the field. Gene expression reported here indicates functional variation in populations of Symbiodinium spp. associated with P. astreoides in the Florida Keys, and is likely a result of localized adaptation.

These species span two major adaptive radiations within Clade B, each encompassing both host-specialized and ecologically cryptic taxa.

Comparatively, SS cells exhibited a temporally stable transcriptomic response and downregulated many stress response genes that were upregulated by the WT. Among the most highly upregulated genes in the SS at 31 degrees C were algal transcription factors and a gene probably of bacterial origin that encodes a type II secretion system protein, suggesting interactions with bacteria may contribute to the increased thermal tolerance of the SS.

To describe the underpinnings of symbiosis and heat stress response, we compared in hospite and free-living transcriptomes of Durusdinium trenchii, a pan-tropical heat-tolerant Symbiodiniaceae species, under stable temperature conditions and acute hyperthermal stress. We discovered that symbiotic state was a larger driver of the transcriptional landscape than heat stress. The majority of differentially expressed transcripts between in hospite and free-living cells were downregulated, suggesting the in hospite condition is associated with the shutdown of numerous processes uniquely required for a free-living lifestyle. In the free-living state, we identified enrichment for numerous cell signalling pathways and other functions related to detecting and responding to a changing environment, as well as transcripts relating to mitosis, meiosis, and motility.

Hyperthermal stress induced drastic alteration of transcriptional activity in hospite, suggesting symbiotic engagement with the host elicited an exacerbated stress response when compared to free-living D. trenchii.

To what extent this diversity is reflected on the amino acid level of functional genes such as enzymatic antioxidants that play an important role in thermal stress tolerance of the coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis is, however, unknown. Here we present a predicted structural analysis and phylogenetic characterization of the enzymatic antioxidant repertoire of the genus Symbiodinium. We also report gene expression and enzymatic activity under short-term thermal stress in Symbiodinium of the B1 genotype. Results: Based on eight different ITS2 types, covering six clades, multiple protein isoforms for three of the four investigated antioxidants (ascorbate peroxidase [APX], catalase peroxidase [KatG], manganese superoxide dismutase [MnSOD]) are present in the genus Symbiodinium. Amino acid sequences of both SOD metalloforms (Fe/Mn), as well as KatG, exhibited a number of prokaryotic characteristics that were also supported by the protein phylogeny. In contrast to the bacterial form, KatG in Symbiodinium is characterized by extended functionally important loops and a shortened C-terminal domain. Intercladal sequence variations were found to be much higher in both peroxidases, compared to SODs. For APX, these variable residues involve binding sites for substrates and cofactors, and might therefore differentially affect the catalytic properties of this enzyme between clades. While expression of antioxidant genes was successfully measured in Symbiodinium B1, it was not possible to assess the link between gene expression and protein activity due to high variability in expression between replicates, and little response in their enzymatic activity over the three-day experimental period. Conclusions: The genus Symbiodinium has a diverse enzymatic antioxidant repertoire that has similarities to prokaryotes, potentially as a result of horizontal gene transfer or events of secondary endosymbiosis. Different degrees of sequence evolution between SODs and peroxidases might be the result of potential selective pressure on the conserved molecular function of SODs as the first line of defence. In contrast, genetic redundancy of hydrogen peroxide scavenging enzymes might permit the observed variations in peroxidase sequences. Our data and successful measurement of antioxidant gene expression in Symbiodinium will serve as basis for further studies of coral health.","1471-2148","",NA,"18-Mar",2015,15,"",NA,"","48","10.1186/s12862-015-0326-0",NA,"","WOS:000353676900001",25887897,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1

Moderate to severe heat stress at 26A degrees C and 29A degrees C (+3A degrees C and +6A degrees C above average sea temperature) resulted in an increase in algal Hsp70 gene expression from 39% to 57%, while extreme heat stress (+9A degrees C) reduced Hsp70 transcript abundance by 60% (after 18 h) and 70% (after 120 h). Elevated temperatures decreased an Hsp90 expression under both rapid and gradual heat stress scenarios. Comparable Hsp70 and Hsp90 gene expression patterns were observed in Symbiodinium cultures and in hospite, indicating their independent regulation from the host. Differential gene expression profiles observed for Hsp70 and Hsp90 suggests diverse roles of these molecular chaperones during heat stress response.

Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have enabled transcriptome-wide profiling of the stress response of the cnidarian coral host; however, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular response to stress of coral-associated Symbiodinium, as well as differences among physiologically susceptible and tolerant types, remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine the transcriptome-wide response to heat stress via RNA-Seq of two types of Symbiodinium, the putatively thermotolerant type D2 and the more susceptible type C3K, resident within the same coral host species, Acropora hyacinthus. Contrary to previous findings with coral hosts, we find no detectable change in gene expression across the dinoflagellate transcriptome after 3 days of elevated thermal exposure, despite physical evidence of symbiosis breakdown. However, hundreds of genes identified as orthologs between the C and D types exhibited significant expression differences within treatments (i.e., attributable solely to type, not heat exposure). These include many genes related to known thermotolerance mechanisms including heat shock proteins and chloroplast membrane components.

In order to characterize the repertoire of endogenous smRNAs and potential gene targets in dinoflagellates, we conducted smRNA and mRNA expression profiling over 9 experimental treatments of cultures from Symbiodinium microadriaticum, a photosynthetic symbiont of scleractinian corals. Results: We identified a set of 21 novel smRNAs that share stringent key features with functional microRNAs from other model organisms. smRNAs were predicted independently over all 9 treatments and their putative gene targets were identified. We found 1,720 animal-like target sites in the 3' UTRs of 12,858 mRNAs and 19 plant-like target sites in 51,917 genes.

Over this time period, the gene expression of five Symbiodinium acpPC genes was quantified. Three acpPC genes exhibited up-regulated expression when corals were exposed to temperatures above 31.5 degrees C (acpPCSym_1:1, day sixteen; acpPCSym_15, day twelve; and acpPCSym_18, day ten and day sixteen).

Sequence analysis of the CYP C-terminal region and two conserved domains, the ""PERF"" and ""heme-binding"" domains, confirmed the separate identities of the CYP genes analyzed. In order to explore the effects of different heat stress scenarios, samples of the scleractinian coral Acropora millepora were exposed to elevated temperatures incrementally over an 18-h period (rapid thermal stress) and over a 120-h period (gradual thermal stress). After 18 h of gradual heating and incubation at 26 degrees C, the Symbiodinium CYP mRNA pool was approximately 30% larger, while a further 6 degrees C increase to a temperature above the average sea temperature (29 degrees C after 72 h) resulted in a 2- to 4-fold increase in CYP expression. Both rapid heat stress and gradual heat stress at 32 degrees C resulted in 50% to 90% decreases in CYP gene transcript abundance. Consequently, the initial upregulation of expression of CYP genes at moderately elevated temperatures (26 degrees C and 29 degrees C) was followed by a decrease in expression under the greater thermal stress conditions at 32 degrees C. These findings indicate that in the coral-alga symbiosis under heat stress conditions there is production of chemical stressors and/or transcriptional factors that regulate the expression of genes, such as the genes encoding cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, that are involved in the first line of an organism's chemical defense.","0099-2240","1098-5336",NA,"MAY",2010,76,"9",2823,"2829","","10.1128/AEM.02984-09",NA,"","WOS:000276907400017",20228102,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1

Our approach comprised the filtering and removal of host sequence reads, subsequent phylogenetic assignment of sequence reads of putative viral origin, and the assembly and analysis of differentially expressed viral genes.

This study is the first to examine the effects of light intensity and quality on the rhythmicity of photosynthesis in the symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium sp., both as a free-living organism and in symbiosis with the coral Stylophora pistillata. Oxygen production measurements in Symbiodinium cultures exhibited rhythmicity with a periodicity of approximately 24 h under constant high light (LL), whereas under medium and low light, the cycle time increased. Exposing Symbiodinium cultures and corals to spectral light revealed different effects of blue and red light on the photosynthetic rhythm, specifically shortening or increasing the cycle time respectively. These findings suggest that the photosynthetic rhythm is entrained by different light cues, which are wired to an endogenous circadian clock. Furthermore, we provide evidence that mRNA expression was higher under blue light for two potential cryptochrome genes and higher under red light for a phytochrome gene isolated from Symbiodinium. These results offer the first evidence of the impact of the intensity and quality of light on the photosynthetic rhythm in algal cells living freely or as part of a symbiotic association. Our results indicate the presence of a circadian oscillator in Symbiodinium governing the photosynthetic apparatus through a light-induced signaling pathway that has yet to be described.","1932-6203","",NA,"17-Aug",2012,7,"8",NA,"","e43264","10.1371/journal.pone.0043264",NA,"","WOS:000308063700070",22912840,NA,NA,NA,NA,"light intensity",1,"none",1

Elevated seawater temperatures have been proposed as the most likely cause of coral bleaching whose severity is enhanced by a limitation in the bioavailability of iron. Iron is required by numerous organisms including the zooxanthellae residing inside the symbiosome of cnidarian cells. However, the knowledge of how symbiotic zooxanthellae obtain iron from the host cells and how elevated water temperature affects the association is very limited. Since cellular iron acquisition is known to be mediated through transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis, a vesicular trafficking pathway specifically regulated by Rab4 and Rab5, we set out to examine the roles of these key proteins in the iron acquisition by the symbiotic Symbiodinium. Thus, we hypothesized that the iron recruitments into symbiotic zooxanthellae-housed symbiosomes may be dependent on rab4/rab5-mediated fusion with vesicles containing iron-bound transferrins and will be retarded under elevated temperature. In this study, we cloned a novel monolobal transferrin (ApTF) gene from the tropical sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella and confirmed that the association of ApTF with A. pulchella Rab4 (ApRab4) or A. pulchella Rab5 (ApRab5) vesicles is inhibited by elevated temperature through immunofluorescence analysis. We confirmed the iron-deficient phenomenon by demonstrating the induced overexpression of iron-deficiency-responsive genes, flavodoxin and high-affinity iron permease 1, and reduced intracellular iron concentration in zooxanthellae under desferrioxamine B (iron chelator) and high temperature treatment. In conclusion, our data are consistent with algal iron deficiency being a contributing factor for the thermal stress-induced bleaching of symbiotic cnidarians.

Alkaline phosphatase (AP), PhnX, PhoA and PhoX expression was profiled for different P conditions using the RT-qPCR method. In a sterile system, Symbiodinium could decompose phosphoesters, such as ATP and glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P), into dissolved inorganic P (DIP) to supplement inorganic phosphorus but could not directly use phosphoesters for growth. The growth rate and photosynthetic efficiency of zooxanthellae in phosphoester-containing media did not significantly differ from those in the DIP group but were significantly inhibited in medium containing phosphonates such as N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine (glyphosate) and 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid (2-AEP), as well as in DIP-poor medium. The phosphonate group DIP concentration did not change remarkably, indicating that phosphonates can neither be directly used by zooxanthellae nor decomposed into DIP. Our RT-qPCR results support our views that the phosphoesters (C-O-P) had been hydrolyzed outside the cell before being absorbed into the Symbiodinium cell, and implies that PhnX, PhoA and PhoX are perhaps responsible for transporting DIP from medium into cells and for storage of DIP.","0168-6496","1574-6941",NA,"NOV",2019,95,"11",NA,"","fiz150","10.1093/femsec/fiz150",NA,"","WOS:000507366200009",31580458,NA,NA,NA,NA,"nutrients",1,"none",1

However, the mechanisms involved in this translocation are not well understood. Glycerol has been identified in the literature as one of the main photosynthates translocated from symbiont to host. Considering that glycerol is a preferred regulatory osmolyte in many unicellular eukaryotes and exposure of isolated symbionts to host homogenate results in the liberation of glycerol, we investigated the potential role of glycerol and its release in Symbiodinium. We studied the response to high osmolarity in two cultured species of Symbiodinium, examining glycerol production, specific activity of the enzyme glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and expression of the coding gene. We also assessed the production of glycerol and glucose under osmotic stress and nitrogen depletion. Results showed that cells exposed to high osmolarity conditions induced the synthesis of glycerol, although it was not retained effectively inside cells. In addition, nitrogen depletion also induced the synthesis of glycerol, although values were an order of magnitude lower. Interestingly, a significant decrease in glucose levels was detected in osmotically stressed cultures and under low nitrogen, possibly associated with the storage of carbon. While glycerol is a metabolite induced by osmotic stress, our results do not support its role as osmolyte. We conclude that glycerol may have a role as a sink for reducing power to prevent feedback inhibition of photosynthesis, particularly under low nitrogen, conditions that may be prevalent in the symbiosis.","0025-3162","1432-1793",NA,"MAY",2016,163,"5",NA,"","128","10.1007/s00227-016-2899-6",NA,"","WOS:000375330500035",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"nutrients",1,"none",1

One of the newly identified actin sequences (SyAct-F1) was the most closely related to partial actin cDNA sequences (named AGfact-p and AFcact-p) isolated from adult colonies of two reef corals (Galaxea fascicularis and Favites chinensis) that were inhabited by Symbiodinium spp., suggesting the possibility that the latter two were from the symbionts. Partial AFcact-p sequences could be amplified by PCR using genomic DNA prepared from a symbiotic adult colony of F. chinensis as the template, but not from planula larvae in which zooxanthellae could not be detected, also arguing for the origin of AFcact-p in the symbiont. An expression analysis showed that the levels of the SyAct-A1 mRNA were comparable in symbiotic and non-symbiotic states, and also in motile and non-motile phases in a cultured condition, suggesting its usefulness as a constitutively expressed control gene in expression analysis of Symbiodinium mRNAs.","0921-8971","1573-5176",NA,"APR",2006,18,"2",219,"225","","10.1007/s10811-006-9106-y",NA,"","WOS:000239891700014",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"none",NA

Since the algal symbionts provide the energy basis for corals and whole reefs, their loss or impairment of function leads to widespread mortality. This phenomenon has been documented numerous times in recent years, and has extensively damaged coral reefs all over the world. Temperature has been found to be the major cause of bleaching, and rising sea temperatures have increased the frequency of these catastrophic episodes. To characterize the response of zooxanthellae to temperature stress at the molecular level, we used the mRNA differential display technique to monitor changes in the abundance of specific mRNA species in the cell under different temperature conditions. Axenically grown zooxanthellae were exposed to a range of temperatures (21.7, 17, 26 degrees C) before extraction of their mRNA. Of numerous differentially expressed sequences, seven mRNA species were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced. One of those sequences was positively identified as encoding a multifunction cell surface aminopeptidase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, which is active in cell matrix adhesion. Our work illustrates the power of the differential display technique as a useful tool to study the response of zooxanthellae to stressors.","1436-2228","1436-2236",NA,"JUN",2006,8,"3",268,"274","","10.1007/s10126-005-5008-2",NA,"","WOS:000238157700006",16614872,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temperature",1,"none",1
